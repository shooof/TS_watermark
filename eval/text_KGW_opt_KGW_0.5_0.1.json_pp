It ranked the top applicants with post-Alice allowance withdrawals. Unsurprisingly IBM, eBay and Microsoft were the top three assignees, named in 47, 19 and 15 applications respectively. Perhaps more surprisingly, gaming companies IGT and WMS Gaming are in the top 10. Also appearing are finance companies JP Morgan, American Express and Bank of America, which reflects the impact of Alice on financial services patents.\nThe Supreme Court has declined to hear the appeal of a dispute over the copyright on Sherlock Holmes. On November 2 it left intact a ruling that 50 works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring the famous detective are in the public domain.\nDoyle\u2019s estate had been trying to get writer Leslie Klinger to pay a licence for using the Sherlock Holmes character in a compendium of new stories. A fee was paid for the first The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes but Klinger refused to pay a licence fee for the second installment.\nIn June, the Seventh Circuit ruled that the copyright on 46 stories and four novels featuring Holmes were in the public domain. In August, Judge Richard Posner ordered Doyle\u2019s estate to pay legal fees to Klinger and branded its demands \u201ca form of extortion\u201d.\nThe past week threw up a bizarre copyright question: can you copyright a backside? As reported in a post on The IPKat blog, Kim Kardashian believes fitness model Jen Selter is copying her poses when posting pictures of her backside on Instagram. Kardashian has reportedly asked her lawyers to investigate whether there is a copyright infringement.\nThe IPKat blog gave a detailed analysis of the issues involved, from an EU perspective at least.

But, after an analysis of the evidence, the IPKat suggests it is hard to see how the courts should rule in favour of Selter, given the strong case that Kardashian\u2019s backside has been copied without permission.\nOn Friday the IPKat reported on another case involving a backside, a case of a swim-suit photo of an American tennis player that was taken for a magazine\u2019s Swimsuit Edition.

{"prefix": "The Seven Cs of Political Leadership!\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today.\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today. And though I have written considerably on leadership, it has mainly been about corporate leadership.\nLeadership in corporations is massively different from political leadership, and therefore it requires a special model and a special line of thinking. While in corporations the final aim is profit maximisation in most cases, in politics the final objective is necessarily social welfare maximisation.\nWhile in corporations the best leaders are often the best marketing guys, in politics the best leaders necessarily have to be the people who are the sincerest and most hard working. While in business you can make do without the knowledge of economics, in politics that can be suicidal. While in business being unethical can harm you and at most your stake holders, in politics the lack of ethics ruins an entire nation's future.\nAnd most importantly, while in corporations leadership is about commitment to the strongest and survival of the fittest, in political leadership, the focus always is about commitment to the weakest and survival of the weakest. Thus, for me, political leadership is not just about having certain qualities but also simultaneously about not having various qualities. Rather, what is important is to ensure that one does not possess certain specific qualities first; if that is taken care of, the rest would then automatically fall in place.\nKeeping all the above in mind, I believe the model of the seven winning virtues of political leadership (viz credibility, compassion, clairvoyance, camaraderie, commitment, charisma and competence) that I have developed is most suited for Indian politicians in particular.\nWell, the difference in this model and any other such model is that in this model, each element or virtue is actually the opposite of one of the seven sins of life -- the seven deadly sins that we are supposed to avoid; to a large extent, as normal human beings and to an almost extreme extent, as a political leader! The first sin that a leader must avoid is that of greed. This is what seems to be the biggest problem with political leaders in India. The reason behind all the lack of development in India at the cost", "gold_completion": " of swelling Swiss bank accounts. The second sin every politician needs to avoid is gluttony.\nThe next sin a leader must avoid is the sin of sloth. Sloth is being spiritually and emotionally apathetic and being physically and emotionally inactive. The fourth sin that leaders must avoid is envy. The fifth sin to avoid is the sin of lust. It refers to the way politicians have been doing things -- from threats to hide their lust filled deeds to even murders.\nThe sixth sin that political leaders need to avoid is the sin of pride! And that brings us to the final deadly sin that every political leader should avoid. The sin of wrath. This is what political leadership all about -- avoiding the seven keys sins and instead developing the seven winning virtues to lead their countries towards a better future. That's what great leaders were all about. Their lives are a lesson in avoiding the seven sins and delivering on the winning virtues! May a day come when Indian leaders are full of these seven virtues.", "no_wm_completion": " of many hundreds of millions of people who are suffering like this every day.\nSo the first sin is that of greed; it must be avoided. I don't want to get into the discussion whether greed is bad or not, but it certainly does not seem good for a country, and for the leader. On the way, greed also tends to be accompanied by a lot of arrogance and selfishness; in short, one tends to believe that he or she is not only right, but also important and very much superior to everyone else.\nSo, the first sin of leadership is not just greed; it is actually the complete lack of appreciation of the social environment in which it is possible for any leader to thrive.\nThe second sin of the Indian politician is that of complacency. This is the very reason why Indians do not really have a culture of progress and development, despite all the efforts of the leaders and of some media pundits to paint it as the way to go.

{"prefix": "When it comes to safety in the workplace, organizational culture can be quite literally a matter of life and death. Look no further than the example of BP.\nAs one of the world's largest oil producers, BP has a troubled safety record. As Forbes reports, one of BP's plants has an unusually tragic past, including an explosion in 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured 180. This plant also reported 23 worker fatalities in the three decades that preceded the 2005 accident.\nWhen Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refiner in the U.S., bought the plant from BP, many in the industry thought it was a risky move. But Marathon had ideas for how to rectify the situation by instituting a culture centered on safety.\nRemedying the culture required a review of the plant's existing safety procedures. Following the 2005 explosion, federal investigators pointed to BP's problematic safety culture -- for example, with managers who were \"checking off boxes\" rather than promoting best practices for safety -- as the cause of the plant's many safety problems. BP failed to respond and paid dearly for its inaction in 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 and spilling more than 3 million barrels of oil. The incident cost the company $54 billion in damages.\nAs BP's record illustrates, organizational culture matters a great deal to employee safety. Cultures in which employees are engaged in their work are safer places to work. Gallup's 2016 meta-analysis study -- which examined more than 82,000 business units and 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations, across 49 industries and in 73 countries -- shows that business units with engagement scores in the top quartile of Gallup's employee engagement database have 70% fewer safety incidents compared with bottom-quartile units.\nTheir employees are committed to doing quality work. When workers are committed to a standard of excellence in all they do, it's natural for them to adhere to best practices that prevent safety incidents. When employees are dedicated to quality, they go the extra mile to do things right the first time. By taking the right strategic action -- for example, by holding employees accountable for quality -- leaders can develop a workforce that makes smart decisions throughout the day and promotes a culture of workplace safety.\nThe mission or purpose of the company makes employees feel their job is important. Many of the world's most engaged organizations maintain a purpose-driven culture. Their leaders know why the company exists and ensure that employees understand and identify with that purpose. When workers embrace the mission of an organization and connect with that purpose both personally and professionally, they are more likely to think \"big picture\" in all areas of their work. Employees who are aligned with the company's mission are also more likely to approach their work with thoughtfulness and attention to detail, which contributes to a culture of safety.\nEmployees feel that their opinions count. It's a simple notion: Listen to workers who are closest to the action. These individuals offer a front-line perspective on organizational problems and often are well-versed in preventing and overcoming them. Leaders should encourage employees to watch for hazards and should make it easy for them to share their feedback and concerns. Most importantly, when leaders act on the information they receive, it demonstrates to employees that their opinions matter -- and it can help companies avoid preventable safety incidents.\nAn unsafe workplace can have far-reaching effects on a company and its employees. Productivity can suffer, and insurance claims can significantly damage a company's bottom line. But no company can quantify the cost of the most serious accidents. Any expenses to the business pale in comparison with the infinite cost to", "gold_completion": " the families of the individuals whose lives were tragically lost on the Deepwater Horizon or who were killed or injured in the BP refinery explosion.\nGiven the potential consequences of a safety incident, leaders can't afford to be haphazard about safety. Regardless of industry or company size, all businesses need to do everything in their power to develop an engaged workforce that is committed to avoiding safety incidents. This means ensuring that employees are committed to quality work, believe in their company's mission and purpose and are confident in expressing their opinions. To keep employees safe, leaders need to create a culture of safety.\nFor former BP employees, the Marathon Petroleum acquisition -- and the cultural changes that have followed -- may create a safer environment that is the difference between life and death. As CEO Gary Heminger put it, \"We've taken our culture into that refinery. We're going to operate it with the best safety and environmental skills available.\"\nStephanie Plowman contributed to the research in this article.", "no_wm_completion": " a company's employees.\nThis is just one of the many reasons leaders need to promote and maintain a culture of safety. When leaders prioritize their company vision and mission and take action on their employees' concerns, it can make a big difference in how a company is perceived.

{"prefix": "DJ Premier will be the first artist to release a single on the newly-revived imprint, in a nod to its early-1990s roots.\nPatrick Moxey, the founder of dance and electronic label Ultra Music, is going back to his roots with the relaunch of Payday Records, the classic hip-hop label he created in 1992 that served as the label home of artists like Gang Starr, Group Home, Jeru the Damaja and Showbiz & A.G., among others. As part of the company's revival, Moxey is teaming back up with DJ Premier for a new single, \"Our Streets\" feat. A$AP Ferg, set to drop tomorrow (Nov. 3).\nWhen Moxey first launched Payday 25 years ago, it was at the center of New York's golden age of hip-hop, with Premier heavily involved as one of the go-to producers and, alongside Guru in Gang Starr, key artists in the scene at the time. In 1995, Payday also released the first-ever single from Jay-Z, \"In My Lifetime,\" a year before his debut album Reasonable Doubt was released in June 1996, and released a slew of albums and singles from the likes of WC and the MAAD Circle, O.C. and UTD, Mos Def's first hip-hop group.\nAlongside Premier, Payday has deals with New Orleans MC Pell, Atlanta veteran OJ Da Juiceman, U.K. rapper Yung Fume and NYC collective Gloss Gang.\n\"Hip-hop has become a global language, and I think the new Payday is here to reflect that and to help bring a bunch of diverse and talented new artists to the world,\" Moxey tells Billboard. \"Our first signings are from four different cities: New York, Atlanta, New Orleans and London. That reflects the fact that we have one computer in front of us and that computer knows no borders.\"\nPayday will operate as a standalone label with the backing of Ultra's sales, marketing and promotions structure, with product management and A&R staff in New York and the U.K. and flexible deals for its artists. And in another nod to the label's roots, Neale Easterby, the CEO of Empire Artist Management who helped manage Gang Starr along with Moxey, will serve as the label's managing director in the U.K.\n\"Payday the label came out of my warehouse parties in the early '90s; we did De La Soul's first show, we did Rob Base's first show, Q-Tip would DJ,\" Moxey says. \"That was the excitement of that time. I think that still holds true today, but with a new generation. To have those moments to do the unexpected -- that's what we're looking to do.\"\n\"Patrick always had his ear to the street and it didn't take a lot of explaining the culture since he was so involved with so many aspects of it,\" DJ Premier said in a statement. \"Our memories of growing together [are] monumental, so relaunching Payday brings it all back to the roots of where our flight to success lifted off.\"", "gold_completion": "\nPayday is also the latest legacy label to be relaunched this year, following Capitol Music Group's resurrection of Priority Records -- itself an early-'90s hip-hop institution, which started with a focus on the West Coast -- in June, and Warner Music Group's relaunch of Asylum Records earlier this week. Moxey sees Payday as both a global hub for hip-hop and one that will reflect the cultural aspects of its original era, beyond just music.\n\"It was a magic time in New York,\" he says about the company's origins, \"at a moment when hip-hop was very cultural: it was about the music, it was about the photographers, it was about the video makers, Triple Five Soul, many different aspects of it. I think it's important that all of that gets emphasized, and we'll be paying special attention at Payday to not just music, but all the related strands of art that go with that real culture around it.\"", "no_wm_completion": "\nMoxey tells us his biggest hope with Payday is to have enough momentum in a year or so to put enough artists with an exciting, forward-thinking concept together to continue the momentum that Payday gained over its 20 plus year career. \"We're going to bring fresh ideas for the fans to enjoy,\" he says.\n\"In My Lifetime\" is out now via Payday/Ultra Records.\nStay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
