It ranked the top applicants with post-Alice allowance withdrawals. Unsurprisingly IBM, eBay and Microsoft were the top three assignees, named in 47, 19 and 15 applications respectively. Perhaps more surprisingly, gaming companies IGT and WMS Gaming are in the top 10.

On November 2 it left intact a ruling that 50 works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring the famous detective are in the public domain.\nDoyle\u2019s estate had been trying to get writer Leslie Klinger to pay a licence for using the Sherlock Holmes character in a compendium of new stories. A fee was paid for the first The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes but Klinger refused to pay a licence fee for the second installment.\nIn June, the Seventh Circuit ruled that the copyright on 46 stories and four novels featuring Holmes were in the public domain. In August, Judge Richard Posner ordered Doyle\u2019s estate to pay legal fees to Klinger and branded its demands \u201ca form of extortion\u201d.\nThe past week threw up a bizarre copyright question: can you copyright a backside? As reported in a post on The IPKat blog, Kim Kardashian believes fitness model Jen Selter is copying her poses when posting pictures of her backside on Instagram. Kardashian has reportedly asked her lawyers to investigate whether there is a copyright infringement.\nThe IPKat blog gave a detailed analysis of the issues involved, from an EU perspective at least.

{"prefix": "The Seven Cs of Political Leadership!\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today.\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today. And though I have written considerably on leadership, it has mainly been about corporate leadership.\nLeadership in corporations is massively different from political leadership, and therefore it requires a special model and a special line of thinking. While in corporations the final aim is profit maximisation in most cases, in politics the final objective is necessarily social welfare maximisation.\nWhile in corporations the best leaders are often the best marketing guys, in politics the best leaders necessarily have to be the people who are the sincerest and most hard working. While in business you can make do without the knowledge of economics, in politics that can be suicidal. While in business being unethical can harm you and at most your stake holders, in politics the lack of ethics ruins an entire nation's future.\nAnd most importantly, while in corporations leadership is about commitment to the strongest and survival of the fittest, in political leadership, the focus always is about commitment to the weakest and survival of the weakest. Thus, for me, political leadership is not just about having certain qualities but also simultaneously about not having various qualities. Rather, what is important is to ensure that one does not possess certain specific qualities first; if that is taken care of, the rest would then automatically fall in place.\nKeeping all the above in mind, I believe the model of the seven winning virtues of political leadership (viz credibility, compassion, clairvoyance, camaraderie, commitment, charisma and competence) that I have developed is most suited for Indian politicians in particular.\nWell, the difference in this model and any other such model is that in this model, each element or virtue is actually the opposite of one of the seven sins of life -- the seven deadly sins that we are supposed to avoid; to a large extent, as normal human beings and to an almost extreme extent, as a political leader! The first sin that a leader must avoid is that of greed. This is what seems to be the biggest problem with political leaders in India.

It refers to the way politicians have been doing things -- from threats to hide their lust filled deeds to even murders.\nThe sixth sin that political leaders need to avoid is the sin of pride! And that brings us to the final deadly sin that every political leader should avoid. The sin of wrath. This is what political leadership all about -- avoiding the seven keys sins and instead developing the seven winning virtues to lead their countries towards a better future. That's what great leaders were all about. Their lives are a lesson in avoiding the seven sins and delivering on the winning virtues!

On the way, greed also tends to be accompanied by a lot of arrogance and selfishness; in short, one tends to believe that he or she is not only right, but also important and very much superior to everyone else.\nSo, the first sin of leadership is not just greed; it is actually the complete lack of appreciation of the social environment in which it is possible for any leader to thrive.\nThe second sin of the Indian politician is that of complacency.

{"prefix": "When it comes to safety in the workplace, organizational culture can be quite literally a matter of life and death. Look no further than the example of BP.\nAs one of the world's largest oil producers, BP has a troubled safety record. As Forbes reports, one of BP's plants has an unusually tragic past, including an explosion in 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured 180. This plant also reported 23 worker fatalities in the three decades that preceded the 2005 accident.\nWhen Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refiner in the U.S., bought the plant from BP, many in the industry thought it was a risky move. But Marathon had ideas for how to rectify the situation by instituting a culture centered on safety.\nRemedying the culture required a review of the plant's existing safety procedures. Following the 2005 explosion, federal investigators pointed to BP's problematic safety culture -- for example, with managers who were \"checking off boxes\" rather than promoting best practices for safety -- as the cause of the plant's many safety problems. BP failed to respond and paid dearly for its inaction in 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 and spilling more than 3 million barrels of oil. The incident cost the company $54 billion in damages.\nAs BP's record illustrates, organizational culture matters a great deal to employee safety. Cultures in which employees are engaged in their work are safer places to work. Gallup's 2016 meta-analysis study -- which examined more than 82,000 business units and 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations, across 49 industries and in 73 countries -- shows that business units with engagement scores in the top quartile of Gallup's employee engagement database have 70% fewer safety incidents compared with bottom-quartile units.\nTheir employees are committed to doing quality work. When workers are committed to a standard of excellence in all they do, it's natural for them to adhere to best practices that prevent safety incidents. When employees are dedicated to quality, they go the extra mile to do things right the first time. By taking the right strategic action -- for example, by holding employees accountable for quality -- leaders can develop a workforce that makes smart decisions throughout the day and promotes a culture of workplace safety.\nThe mission or purpose of the company makes employees feel their job is important. Many of the world's most engaged organizations maintain a purpose-driven culture. Their leaders know why the company exists and ensure that employees understand and identify with that purpose. When workers embrace the mission of an organization and connect with that purpose both personally and professionally, they are more likely to think \"big picture\" in all areas of their work. Employees who are aligned with the company's mission are also more likely to approach their work with thoughtfulness and attention to detail, which contributes to a culture of safety.\nEmployees feel that their opinions count. It's a simple notion: Listen to workers who are closest to the action. These individuals offer a front-line perspective on organizational problems and often are well-versed in preventing and overcoming them. Leaders should encourage employees to watch for hazards and should make it easy for them to share their feedback and concerns. Most importantly, when leaders act on the information they receive, it demonstrates to employees that their opinions matter -- and it can help companies avoid preventable safety incidents.\nAn unsafe workplace can have far-reaching effects on a company and its employees. Productivity can suffer, and insurance claims can significantly damage a company's bottom line. But no company can quantify the cost of the most serious accidents. Any expenses to the business pale in comparison with the infinite cost to", "gold_completion": " the families of the individuals whose lives were tragically lost on the Deepwater Horizon or who were killed or injured in the BP refinery explosion.\nGiven the potential consequences of a safety incident, leaders can't afford to be haphazard about safety. Regardless of industry or company size, all businesses need to do everything in their power to develop an engaged workforce that is committed to avoiding safety incidents. This means ensuring that employees are committed to quality work, believe in their company's mission and purpose and are confident in expressing their opinions. To keep employees safe, leaders need to create a culture of safety.\nFor former BP employees, the Marathon Petroleum acquisition -- and the cultural changes that have followed -- may create a safer environment that is the difference between life and death. As CEO Gary Heminger put it, \"We've taken our culture into that refinery. We're going to operate it with the best safety and environmental skills available.\"\nStephanie Plowman contributed to the research in this article.", "no_wm_completion": " a company's employees.\nThis is just one of the many reasons leaders need to promote and maintain a culture of safety. When leaders prioritize their company vision and mission and take action on their employees' concerns, it can make a big difference in how a company is perceived.

As part of the company's revival, Moxey is teaming back up with DJ Premier for a new single, \"Our Streets\" feat. A$AP Ferg, set to drop tomorrow (Nov. 3).\nWhen Moxey first launched Payday 25 years ago, it was at the center of New York's golden age of hip-hop, with Premier heavily involved as one of the go-to producers and, alongside Guru in Gang Starr, key artists in the scene at the time. In 1995, Payday also released the first-ever single from Jay-Z, \"In My Lifetime,\" a year before his debut album Reasonable Doubt was released in June 1996, and released a slew of albums and singles from the likes of WC and the MAAD Circle, O.C. and UTD, Mos Def's first hip-hop group.\nAlongside Premier, Payday has deals with New Orleans MC Pell, Atlanta veteran OJ Da Juiceman, U.K. rapper Yung Fume and NYC collective Gloss Gang.\n\"Hip-hop has become a global language, and I think the new Payday is here to reflect that and to help bring a bunch of diverse and talented new artists to the world,\" Moxey tells Billboard. \"Our first signings are from four different cities: New York, Atlanta, New Orleans and London. That reflects the fact that we have one computer in front of us and that computer knows no borders.\"\nPayday will operate as a standalone label with the backing of Ultra's sales, marketing and promotions structure, with product management and A&R staff in New York and the U.K. and flexible deals for its artists.

Moxey sees Payday as both a global hub for hip-hop and one that will reflect the cultural aspects of its original era, beyond just music.\n\"It was a magic time in New York,\" he says about the company's origins, \"at a moment when hip-hop was very cultural: it was about the music, it was about the photographers, it was about the video makers, Triple Five Soul, many different aspects of it.

It was a special pie in that I had never heard of elderberries. Personally, I still think that they taste a little like blueberries. This fruit was amazing. Don\u2019t ever turn down an elderberry pie if you have an option to have a piece. I have found that these elderberries are not widely known, but everyone that I know that has tasted these berries has loved them. From what I can see over the years this elderberry is loved by a variety of different wildlife, which will provide some competition.\nFrom my own experience I can seriously say to my reader who asked me for help with this wonderful plant a person who wants to grow them in Summit County will have success with a modest amount of effort. The only trial is that there are 25 different species around the world and at least six different cultivars of Elderberries and each of these have different requirements to some extent.\nThere are a number of different nurseries in the area that do raise elderberries. I have grown two different elderberries in my yard with success over the years. For me I think of this plant as more of a medium to tall shrub because it can grow from 5 to 12 feet tall. This compound leaf shrub does the best in moist soils but will tolerate dry soil, soil pH does not have much effect on this shrub, but grows suckers very well, because it grows stolons like strawberries.\nYou will have to prune this shrub regularly for this plant to do well. Over the centuries elderberry has been grown in hedges to access the fruit. Challenges to elderberry are a variety of borers, cankers and leaf spots, which can be serious to these plants. If you wanted more elderberry plants, you can propagate them by cuttings and seeds. Sambucus canadensis or American elder is considered a native bog plant found from Nova Scotia to Florida to Texas originally introduced in 1761 from Europe.\nSambucol a wonderful cold, cough and fever treatment an Israeli medication that we can find here in the U.S. has as the base Sambucus nigra leaves or fruit. What you can do is make a tea of the drupe or berry and some of the dried leaves as treatment even for the flu and other virus based diseases.\nAt the Kibbutz Aza in Israel many people in the Kibbutz came down with the flu so they tested Sambucol. Twenty percent of these flu sufferers showed significant relief of fever, muscle aches and other symptoms within 24 hours, 73 percent felt better after the second day, and in three days 90 percent were completely cured.\nMany cultures have used this elderberry or sambucus nigra fruit as a juice for treating tonsillitis. This sambucol stimulates the immune system and has shown success against Epstein-Barr, herpes, and even HIV. If you make a tea out of the dried leaves you may find help for arthritis, inflammation, viruses and cancer. The flavonoids in elderberries are high in anti-oxidants such as vitamin C, which has 87 percent of the RDA, Vitamin A with 17 percent RDA, and includes iron, potassium, vitamin B6 and lots of beta carotene. Flowers from the elderberry can be used as an antiseptic wash or poultice to treat wounds or eye inflammations.\nElderberries are also a favorite among many birds for many reasons.

There is nothing wrong with taking the time to help an elderberry get started and bloom into a wonderful old plant.\nI hope you try this out and can find places to grow elderberry trees and shrubs. I have enjoyed taking care of these plants. You can email me at paulschultz3@gmail.com to reach me. Best wishes.

{"prefix": "As the Obama administration winds down more than a decade of war, the budget request \u2014 only fragments of which were released Thursday \u2014 is supposed to account for cuts of $487 billion in projected spending over the next 10 years.\nPentagon officials said their proposal represented tough choices, but the biggest cuts appeared to be in the Defense Department's plan to reduce the number of U.S. ground forces to slightly more than on Sept. 10, 2001, before the wars began.\nAt the same time, the department proposed increasing spending on technology and major weapons systems, after a strategic announcement earlier this month in which defense officials said they must be ready for all kinds of warfare and proposed greater use of unmanned aircraft and a more agile ground force.\nIt wants to raise spending on drones by 30 percent, delay spending on the costly and controversial F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and fund a new bomber and a sea-based vessel that would allow drones and helicopters to take off from international waters. It wants to maintain current spending levels on missile defense and nuclear weapons while increasing spending on cybersecurity.\nTthe department sought to assert that it was simultaneously taking risks and not losing any conventional capability. It said it was responding to growing fiscal pressures because this proposal represented the biggest cut it had made in a decade.\nTheir proposal, officials have said, carries risks because the U.S. military no longer would be able to fight two wars simultaneously and might be required to make difficult decisions about military priorities.\n\"The primary risk lies not in what we can do but in how much we can do and how fast we can do it,\" said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nFor the 2013 fiscal year, the department requests a $525 billion base budget \u2014 a $6 billion decrease from the current budget \u2014 and an additional $88.4 billion in supplemental funding for the war in Afghanistan, down from $115 billion this year.\nFor 2014, the request for the base budget \u2014 which excludes war spending \u2014 jumps to $534 billion; by fiscal year 2017 it reaches $567 billion.\nThe department, which expanded the size of its ground forces quickly over the past decade to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, plans to cut the Army by 2017 to 490,000 soldiers from the current 562,000. Over the same period, the Marines would shrink by 20,000 to 182,000.\nThat would still leave a larger military than before the wars started. In 2001, there were 480,000 soldiers and 180,000 Marines.\nIn line with the smaller forces, the Pentagon calls for retiring planes that transport troops, including 27 C-5As and 65 C-130s. The budget also proposes modest limits on pay raises that would take effect in 2015 \u2014 after the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan is expected to be over \u2014 and increases in health care premiums.\nPanetta said the administration would ask Congress to authorize another round of cuts at U.S. military bases through the base realignment and closure process, which was last employed in 2005. He didn't offer specifics.\nRegardless, the suggestion alone could spark outrage on Capitol Hill, especially in an election year. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Thursday that he wouldn't support closing domestic bases before U.S. bases in Europe were shuttered.\nRep. William \"Mac\" Thornberry, R-Texas, called the proposal for a new BRAC round \"ridiculous, and there is likely little support in Congress for such a thing, on either side of the aisle or either side of the Capitol.

Bloomberg News reported that the projected expenditure on the system would be $9.2 billion, which would buy 29 of the fighters, 13 fewer than initially planned.\nOfficials said they hoped that the delay would give developers time to correct the myriad technical problems plaguing the program.

If many of them took advantage, Facebook\u2019s stock could decline, because the market would be flooded with shares.\nIt's not yet known whether any of those investors had sold any stock because they have three business days to disclose sales, said Sam Hamadeh, the CEO of PrivCo, which researches privately held companies.\nBut many of them likely did, he said. \"A lot of people have been waiting,\" Hamadeh said. \"Facebook was expected to go public a long time ago.\"\nVenture capitalists who invested in Facebook as early as 2005 were likely itching to sell at the earliest opportunity.

{"prefix": "The latest outbreak was swiftly contained by a fast, decisive response, acting as a model for containing infectious diseases in remote places.\nAs anti-climaxes go, it was a most welcome one. On May 11, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) notified the World Health Organization that one of its citizens had been infected with the Ebola virus. The announcement marked the start of the country\u2019s first Ebola outbreak since the historically unprecedented West African epidemic that infected 28,000 people between 2014 and 2016, and killed more than 11,000.\nBut after just 42 days, it was all over.\nWith the last confirmed patient having tested negative for the virus for the second time in a row, the WHO declared an end to the outbreak on Sunday. Just four people had died, and just four more had become infected.\nBut just as importantly, once the first cases were confirmed, the response was fast, decisive, and coordinated\u2014all qualities that were initially missing in West Africa. The DRC response shows that when everything goes right, Ebola can be quickly brought to heel, even when it hits poor, remote places. \u201cWith the end of this epidemic, DRC has once again proved to the world that we can control the very deadly Ebola virus if we respond early in a coordinated and efficient way,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s new Director-General, in a statement.\nThe symptoms of Ebola are greatly exaggerated in the popular press. It\u2019s not a disease of apocalyptic hemorrhaging from every orifice, and symptoms can easily be mistaken for other maladies. In this case, the first patient\u2014a 45-year-old man who contracted the virus on 22 April\u2014initially went to see a traditional healer. When that didn\u2019t work, he took a taxi to a health center\u2014and died on the way. (Both the driver, and a third individual who cared for the man, also eventually died.) The center quickly suspected Ebola and immediately sent samples to a national laboratory in Kinshasa. The staff there had the right knowledge, training, and connections\u2014they ran some preliminary tests while also calling international colleagues. Rimoin flew over with the latest diagnostics.\nAfter the first positive case was confirmed, the government immediately notified the WHO, which activated their emergency protocols. That inaccessibility of Likati was both a blessing and a curse\u2014it made it harder for the virus to spread, but also harder for health workers to reach the infected zone. Fortunately, after the sluggish response to the West African Ebola epidemic, the WHO had set up a $41 million contingency fund to ensure that money would be readily available for future emergencies. This fund allowed them and other organizations to quickly rent helicopters for flying personnel, generators, and supplies into Likati. \u201cWithin 24 hours, we could start airlifting,\u201d says Ibrahima-Soce Fall, director of the health security and emergencies cluster at the WHO\u2019s African office.\nThe team set up a base camp and", "gold_completion": " field lab in the grounds of a former convent.

They spread out through the region\u2019s villages to improve accessibility by fixing bridges and forest tracks. With training from UNICEF and the WHO, they taught local communities how to stop Ebola from spreading, how to safely bury people who die from the disease, and how to disinfect affected homes.\nThe outbreak may be over, but the response continues. For the next 90 days, the WHO will continue to strengthen health services in the region, to ensure that local volunteers are trained to spot possible symptoms should the disease arise again.

{"prefix": "For decades, U.S. schools have failed to provide students with an adequate civics education, which is integral to building and maintaining an engaged and informed voting population.\nHow bad is it? According to the 2018 Annenberg Constitution Day Civics Survey, only 32 percent of Americans can name all three branches of the U.S. government. Even worse, 33 percent could not correctly name one branch.\nUnfortunately, this lack of basic civics knowledge is not restricted to U.S. adults. In 2014, only 23 percent of American students earned a proficient score on the civics portion of the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card\u201d exam. Needless to say, this does not bode well for the future.\nGiven these startling statistics, one would assume that American educators would be working feverishly to find new ways to improve civics courses. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. Only nine states and the District of Columbia require a full year of civics education as a requirement for high school graduation. Thirty-one states require students enroll in only one half-year course.\nAlthough several solutions have been proposed by educators and researchers to solve the civics crisis, none have been widely adopted. One of the most significant civics-related proposals is to require all high school students to pass the U.S. citizenship test, the same test that all immigrants must earn a passing score on before becoming a citizen. Although the movement started with much fanfare, it has since fizzled out; only 17 states have such a requirement.\nSchools are failing miserably to educate millions of Americans in basic civics. However, all is not lost. With a few reasonable changes, a civics education Renaissance is more than attainable.\nAs a former public high school teacher, one who taught courses in both American government and U.S. history, I have firsthand experience in the civics classroom crisis. Like many who have taught these courses before, I believe it is virtually impossible to provide children with the civics education they need in an eight-week civics \u201ccrash course.\u201d It\u2019s simply not enough time to dive into this important and complex subject. Civics, at the very least, should be a full-year course, and students should be offered opportunities to take additional, more advanced civics courses as well.\nSecond, civics standards need a total overhaul. It\u2019s not enough to teach kids how bills become laws, they need to know more about their rights as Americans and understand the history behind the constitutional protections they have been provided. The United States is an exceptional place, but most students are being taught the opposite is true. Yes, some truly terrible things have happened in America \u2014 just as they have in all countries \u2014 but the United States\u2019 commitment to personal freedom has made America the most powerful, wealthy, successful nation the world has ever seen. Students need to understand these ideas. Civics isn\u2019t about laws, it\u2019s about rights and personal freedom.\nThird, state standards are too narrowly focused on knowledge attainment. States typically don\u2019t offer students any form of experiential learning as part of their civics standards. No wonder youth participation in politics is abysmally low. If schools want to improve civics scores, they should teach children why civics is important, and the best way to do that is by getting them directly involved with the lawmaking process through internships, volunteer opportunities, and field trips to local and state government buildings, including state capitols.\nAnother way to increase student engagement is to emphasize student government in schools. If students are able to get actively involved in the governance of their own schools", "gold_completion": ", it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll have a greater interest in the governance of their communities in the future.\nFourth, and perhaps most important, students and parents should be given access to universal education savings accounts, which allow kids to go to any school their parents like. This would permit parents who care about civics to have the option of enrolling their children in schools that teach the values they are most concerned with.\nAlthough these solutions will not solve the civics crisis overnight, they would be a step in the right direction. But in order for any of this to occur, teachers and parents need the freedom and flexibility to accomplish these goals \u2014 flexibility they have been denied by bureaucrats and some disinterested politicians who have proven repeatedly they don\u2019t care about improving civics.\nAchieving progress requires a completely different approach.\nChris Talgo is a former public high school teacher and an editor at The Heartland Institute. He wrote this for InsideSources.com.", "no_wm_completion": " by electing and/or forming student governments, they will be engaged and more likely to become engaged in their communities.\nIn addition, states need to rethink their civics tests. If civics test questions are designed to elicit only one or two responses, students are never going to be able to use the material as an opportunity to learn the concepts they need to know to navigate adulthood.\nFinally, there needs to be more emphasis on teaching a robust citizenship curriculum in the classroom. The problem is this is very much still a work in progress, and it is not up to schools to do the job of providing that curriculum.\nThe real battle that needs to be fought is not with how many states are adopting civics standards or making more extensive civics course offerings, it\u2019s not how many states have a citizenship test, it\u2019s not even how many states require civics courses. Schools should put the responsibility back on kids to learn more about themselves, who they are, and", "gen_completion": " by electing their leadership and by participating as staff on student committees or commissions relevant in school government (e.G. SES, i.G. IFC), well, that doesn\u2018t feel like teaching civics anymore!

Today, these very real atrocities are not an item on any public high school\u2018\u2018 Civic class curriculum.

{"prefix": "Apple: dead in the water, or on top of its game?\nSince I was reading this on my iPad Pro, which is probably the most useful electronic device I have ever owned, it came as a bit of a shock. But in fact Volker was really just articulating a truth about digital hardware, which is that the evolution of all such products (and a good deal else besides) follows a sigmoid curve.\nIt sounds complicated, but it isn\u2019t really. Think of it as a version of the letter S that\u2019s been flattened to form a graph whose vertical axis measures functionality while the horizontal axis represents time. What it tells you is that initially (at the lower part of the S) a new technology develops relatively slowly. Then there\u2019s a point where the functionality increases dramatically over a relatively short period, after which the rate of improvement declines steadily and levels off. The iPad is now somewhere on that upper plateau, which means that it\u2019s reached the point where one can only expect incremental improvements (faster processor, better screen, stereo audio etc). This is what Volker was getting at when he said that the device is \u201cdone\u201d.\nTo the hyperactive tech media sector this means that the product is no longer of any interest and that Apple has \u201crun out of ideas\u201d. In some cases it is also taken as confirmation that the company has never recovered from the death of Steve Jobs. Excitable Wall Street analysts may also see it as evidence that Apple stock should now be downgraded to \u201csell\u201d. All of which merely confirms the extent to which some of those who opine about technology don\u2019t understand it.\nSo let\u2019s put the iPad in its wider context. The device, as one expert, Horace Dediu, comments, has an installed base of 300 million users \u2013 which is far larger than the 100-150m Mac computers out there. And whereas the iPad built up this user base in roughly seven years, the Mac needed 33.\nDigging deeper, Dediu finds that iPad sales continue to increase in the US and the UK, and that user satisfaction with the product continues to be very high. A survey conducted in November 2015 found a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for the iPad Mini, a 97% rate for the iPad Air, and 96% for the iPad Pro; and that browsing, shopping and app usage data also show continuing high utilisation on iPads. Among corporate purchasers there is a 96% satisfaction rate, with 66% intending to purchase more iPads.\nMuch the same applies to the iPhone, another Apple device that attracts the same kind of commentary \u2013 about Apple running out of ideas, that there are only incremental improvements between the iPhone 6 and the forthcoming iPhone 8, and so on. The truth is that that device is also on that upper plateau of the sigmoid curve. It too is \u201cdone\u201d.\nThe", "gold_completion": " same applies to the smartphone generally.

Some day, though, I hope to be able to point my phone at Dr Liam Fox, secretary of state for international trade and president of the board of trade, and see what he\u2019s thinking.

{"prefix": "Less than a century since DDT was first sprayed, the spread of the Zika virus through mosquitoes has left some wondering whether regulators were too quick to move away from the chemical. But public health officials warn returning the controversial pesticide to use could do more harm than good in some places.\nDDT, which first came into use as an insecticide in the 1930s, played a crucial role helping Allied forces protect themselves from mosquitoes carrying malaria in World World II and eventually helped eliminate the deadly disease from the U.S. But despite its successes, public opinion turned quickly in the 1960s as outrage grew over DDT\u2019s potential risks to human health and animals and many countries joined the U.S. in ultimately banning its use.\nToday, health officials caution that while the benefits of the pesticide can outweigh health concerns in some contexts, spraying DDT to combat Zika would be premature and potentially very misguided.\nThe first concern for public health officials when considering whether to use DDT is if the method of applying the pesticide will actually kill the targeted mosquitoes. Most applications of the pesticide today occur on the walls of indoor dwellings\u2014targeting mosquitoes that prey on humans while they sleep at night. This tactic, frequently used in Africa, works in areas where mosquitoes carrying disease bite at night while people are asleep, according to Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Public Health. More research is needed to understand other mosquito populations and learn whether DDT use will be effective.\nPolicymakers also have to weigh the potential effects of DDT on human health. The impact of the chemical is not necessarily immediate, but can be devastating to those who ingest it. Research has suggested that DDT has the potential to disrupt the human nervous system in the same way it does to insects. That may mean cancer, infertility and other long-term health effects including developmental problems in young children.

But it less makes sense, at least for now, when combatting a disease like Zika that doesn\u2019t kill those it infects and has yet to spread as widely. Unnecessary use of DDT will also make it less effective going forward as mosquitoes grow resistant. The first round of spraying DDT will effectively kill a large share of the local mosquito population, but fewer and fewer of the insects will die with each consecutive spray, limiting its utility in a future crisis.\nInstead of focusing on pesticides to address Zika, public health officials are now advocating a comprehensive approach to addressing the virus that includes studying the species of mosquito that spreads the virus, developing a Zika vaccine, eliminating places where mosquitoes can breed and potentially introducing genetically modified mosquitoes that will help reduce the population.", "no_wm_completion": " a risk\nBecause DDT has already been suspended worldwide, it\u2019s been several years since the EPA tested an alternative method of using the pesticide to fight Zika.

But even if this research is completed, officials acknowledge it would be difficult to apply the pesticide on a large-scale basis without worrying about unintended consequences, like a new outbreak of mosquitos carried the virus.\n\u201cThere are not a ton of studies out there on where to apply it and how to apply it, especially in tropical regions,\u201d says Paul Ehrlich, a professor of biology and the founding director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. \u201cAll I can", "gen_completion": " such risk is one possible consideration in making the environmental case in support DDTs return, said Loehnitzke.

Cotter changed his farming methods for financial reasons, not just to fight climate change, and stuck with them long enough to see them pay off.\nCotter sees a new pilot program in the 2018 federal farm bill that pays farmers to experiment with the same growing style as a chance for others to enjoy the economic and environmental benefits he has.\nThe $25 million test project will measure how much additional carbon the agriculture sector can keep out of the atmosphere by leaving fields untilled or minimally tilled and covered with vegetation.\nFarming techniques that fight climate change by increasing carbon stored in soil do not work everywhere, explained Tim Smith, a professor of bioproducts and biosystems engineering at the University of Minnesota. But where they do work, soil quality and productivity improves. They also reduce the need for fertilizers that contribute to carbon in the atmosphere.\nThe pilot program aims to \u201creward farmers for sequestering carbon in their soil, but we need to verify that they are doing that,\u201d said David Kolsrud, who farmed in Luverne before starting a private funding group and working in the renewable-energy sector.\nThe carbon sequestration experiment in the farm bill was the brainchild of an unlikely coalition that includes the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) as well as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the American Coalition for Ethanol. Those normally competing groups came together to persuade Congress to fund a model for encouraging farming that is simultaneously profitable and environmentally friendly.\nThe project will pay selected participants to revive old farming methods to draw more carbon from the atmosphere into the soil and keep it there.\n\u201cAg [has] a major opportunity to protect the climate,\u201d said Nicole Lederer of E-2, a group that advocates for policies that work economically as well as environmentally. Lederer helped broker the deal between the corn growers and the resource council that led to the pilot program.\nFundamentally, the program relies on disturbing the soil as little as possible to limit the release of carbon stored in the roots of plants and decomposing vegetation. It also emphasizes keeping ground covered with crops year-round to prevent the release of carbon from erosion by water or wind.\nCotter said the combination reduces the need for fertilizer. \u201cInstead of spending 20 bucks an acre killing the ground, I want my soil livestock [worms and other organic creatures] doing my tillage,\u201d he said.\nThat can mean planting cover crops rather than letting fields lie fallow. It especially means cutting down on or eliminating tillage, said Lara Bryant, NRDC\u2019s deputy director of water and agriculture nature programs.\nNo-till or low-till farming requires some special equipment. Cotter grows no-till soybeans using an $1,800 adjustment to the closing mechanism on his planter. He grows low-till corn by planting seed in narrow bands about 10 inches wide. He bought a used vertical till machine for $8,000 at auction to help do that and shared the cost of the machine with a neighbor.\nThese sorts of techniques fell out of favor in the 1970s when plentiful land and expanding crop production led farmers to use \u201cmore extractive systems,\u201d according to Bryant. Rewarding those who invest in equipment to return to the old practice is a necessary part of the pilot project.\nThe prospect of cap-and-trade payments for carbon reduction or the development of low-carbon fuel standards and products such as low-carbon feedstock", "gold_completion": " can provide financial incentives, Lederer said.\nThe Minnesota Farmers Union offered its imprimatur to the pilot program as advocates made their case to members of Congress. Farmers union President Gary Wertish said details of how the program will work are still being developed. The basic concept includes paying farmers who undertake healthy soil practices, measuring their success and passing the data on to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to set up payment rates for various practices that could be funded under the agency\u2019s environmental quality incentives program, which averages about $2 billion a year in the new five-year farm bill.\nCalifornia already has a state program that rewards farmers for sequestering carbon in their soil, Kolsrud noted.\nHow well the program would work in Minnesota depends on where you farm. In Blue Earth County, Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap said the short growing season and frozen ground can be obstacles to no-till and cover-crop strategies.", "no_wm_completion": " has drawn more attention in recent years, but farmers, not least because of the way their earnings often fall flat in the recession, still do not have enough incentive for more practices that reduce the carbon that\u2019s in their fields.\n\u201cThe climate change problem is not about who can spend the most money on a technology,\u201d said Smith, whose research focuses on carbon storage.\nThe farmer participation in the project is voluntary. If all goes as planned, it could be expanded. The federal government would assess farmers\u2019 carbon emissions and base their compensation on what they emit. Some might earn rewards for reducing carbon while others could be paid for keeping more.\nThe pilot will be tested on one parcel of land near Austin. It is on a small ranch, part of a farm-to-table effort to produce what local consumers want. \u201cA lot of local folks don\u2019t want to talk about climate change,\u201d said Smith.

Under the new system, average citizens will work alongside judges to issue verdicts in many criminal cases. As Yuriko Nagano reports from Tokyo, the greatest hurdle to the experiment is expected to be persuading Japanese citizens to participate.\nIn Japan, as in most Asian countries, judges alone make decisions in trials. But starting in 2009, juries will be participating in Japanese courts, under what is called a \"saibanin\" system.\nThe new system has not yet been confirmed. At first, it will be tested for three years. And it will be limited in scope.

He spoke to journalists in Tokyo on Thursday.\n\"The saibanin system and these other reforms are intended to transform Japanese citizens from viewing themselves as governed objects into governing objects,\" Precht says.\nFor each trial, there will be a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will be citizens selected at random.\nThe jury panel will sit in the same room with the judges to deliberate on the evidence and reach a verdict.

Experts hope the new reforms will speed them up.\nAnother change to the system will have witnesses take the stand in trials, where attorneys can question them in front of the jury. Currently, all testimony is written, and then given to the judges.\nJapan did use a jury system between 1928 and 1943, but switched to the judges-only process after that.\nThe greatest hurdle, experts say, will be persuading jurors to express their opinions, and even argue with judges.

But he told assembled lawmakers that based on his study of geologic records, he believes warming started significantly before industrialization, in the 17th century.\nHe said the warming the warming since then is natural, and he argued that it's actually a positive thing.\n\"This cold period was marked by crop failure, famine, and mass-depopulation because of naturally-occurring global cooling,\" he said. \"Earth and humanity have benefited greatly from what's been called the long, slow thaw.\"\nMost scientists don't dispute that there was some natural warming after the cold snap of the 17th century.\nBut Wrightstone's broader conclusion, that current warming trends are natural and untethered to CO2 emissions, is directly contrary to the scientific consensus.\nRichard Alley, a geosciences professor at Penn State who specializes in ice core testing, said he doesn't believe there is any natural explanation for the rapid warming that has been measured since the 20th century.\n\"We see the warming,\" he said. \"And then we ask, well is it the sun? No, the sun, if anything is going the other way. Is it the oceans? Well, heat's going into the oceans, it's not coming out. Well, is it anything else we can find? No, it isn't. The CO2 explains what's happening and nothing else does.\"\nMichael Mann, an atmospheric science and geoscience professor, also of Penn State, agreed.\n\"While climate does change naturally, we are warming the planet at an unprecedented rate, putting carbon into the atmosphere a million times faster than the natural geological increases in carbon dioxide that were responsible for e.g. the warmth of the early Cretaceous period,\" he wrote in an email.\nCiting information gathered by the National Research Council, NASA estimates the earth has warmed by approximately 0.7 percent over the last century, which it says represents a rate of warming roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of ice-age recovery.\nClimate change is already harming both human and natural systems.\nWrightstone, who has a master's degree in geology, told the committee that while he has published papers on paleo-climatology, he hasn't written any on contemporary climate science.\nHe has self-published a book on his theories.\nWrightstone spent most of his career in the natural gas industry.\nAfter his testimony, he confirmed he worked as a geologist for the Pittsburgh-based gas company Texas Keystone for 20-odd years, but said the experience doesn't influence his current work.\n\"If I was still receiving payment or being influenced by them, yes,\" he said, his gas industry work might be a", "gold_completion": " factor. \"But that has no influence on me.

Outlets that had previously shied away from, and in some cases covered up, abuses by the Hollywood producer began harassment investigations that saw a host of household media names pushed from their pedestals.\nItaly, home to two of Harvey Weinstein's accusers, also felt the shockwaves. But Italians hoping for a similar impact on their fourth estate, where victim-blaming and objectification are notoriously common - were to be disappointed.\nInstead, two features marked the fallout: the near absence of names named, and the ferocious reaction faced not by the accused, but the accusers.\nItaly, it would seem, had missed its \"Weinstein moment\".\nThe problem is, it's difficult to expose such cases, especially when they happen in the industry that is supposed to be doing the exposing! And that's an industry whose leaders tend to be, on the whole, men.\nSix months on from the scandal, The Listening Post went to Rome and Milan to ask journalists and media experts why the scandal played out so differently in Italy, and to discuss the problematic representation of women in Italy's media more generally.\nOne of Weinstein's Italian accusers is the actress Asia Argento, whose testimony of sexual assault met a media response that - with some exceptions - ranged from scepticism to open abuse.\n\"First they go along with it, then they whine and pretend to repent\", goaded a headline in the conservative newspaper, Libero. Libero's editor, Vittorio Feltri, was one of several prominent journalists to label Argento's story as one of \"prostitution\" - comments that his deputy, Pietro Senaldi, happily defended in his interview with us.\n\"You have to know the man,\" Senaldi insisted. \"It is well known that his journalistic career and his reputation are based on how direct and how blunt he his \u2026\"\nFor Elisa Giomi, a sociologist specialising in gender and media at Rome Three University, it was a feature she told us, that is typical of media coverage of such cases in Italy: \"a tendency to split the victims of sexual harassment into two categories: the innocent ones and the women who asked for it.\"\nWe asked all our contributors why so few cases of harassment, including in the media industry itself, had been uncovered by Italian journalists. Pietro Senaldi's explanation was simple: \"What I think is that in Italy, this phenomenon has not exploded because it is less dramatic than it is in the States. Definitely less dramatic.\"\nIt's a notion each of our female interviewees strongly disputed, pointing out that such cases are not hard to find - if you are looking for them.\n\"Just because there have been no denunciations to date doesn't mean it isn't happening in the media as well,\" said Claudia Torrisi, a contributor to VICE Italy.\n\"The problem is, it's difficult to expose such cases, especially when they happen in the industry that is supposed to be doing the exposing!

It served in a number of major battles, including the Siege of Suffolk, Virginia; Spotsylvania, North Anna, and Cold Harbor, where the regiment saw its heaviest losses. The 155th took part in the Siege of Petersburg, and fighting around that area, and it was part of the forces that chased the Army of Northern Virginia to its destiny, being present at the that force's surrender at Appomattox Court House.\nThe unit mustered into United States service with 820 men; by July 1865, only 130 men were present at Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Virginia.\nDuring the war, many 155th members also belonged to the Fenian Brotherhood. After the war, these veterans joined the 7th New York Regiment of the Irish Army of Liberation, which in June 1866, joined the Fenian invasion of Canada, fighting the Battle of Ridgeway, Ontario, and several smaller actions around Fort Erie. Though victorious on the field, the heavily outnumbered, and unsupported attempt to take control of Canada (to hold for the exchange for Irish independence from Great Britain), failed.

{"prefix": "Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s memoir of her pioneer girlhood, written in 1930, has remained unpublished until now.\nIn 1930, Laura Ingalls Wilder decided to write a memoir of her pioneer girlhood. She was a sixty-three-year-old chicken farmer, living in the Ozarks with her husband and their daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, a well-known journalist and popular author. Wilder\u2019s own literary ambitions were, she told Lane, for \u201cprestige\u201d rather than for money, and they may have dated to her youth, though they had been thwarted by a married life of hardship and calamity.\nWilder would certainly capture the big market. She lived to the age of ninety, and published eight novels for young people\u2014the perennially beloved \u201cLittle House\u201d books\u2014that have sold some sixty million copies in more than thirty languages. In the nineteen-seventies, the third installment of this family saga, \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\u201d was adapted as a drama for television that ran for nine seasons. The Wilder farmhouse, in Rocky Ridge, Missouri, has become a shrine that receives some forty thousand pilgrims a year, and six other sites mentioned in the series are landmarks or museums devoted to its lore. But the memoir that Wilder drafted during the first year of the Depression, in her tidy longhand, filling a series of school notebooks, was never published until now.\n\u201cPioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography\u201d is a handsomely illustrated, large-format volume that represents years of work by a team of scholars. Their project was sponsored by the South Dakota Historical Society, and published by its state-subsidized press last November. Its modest first print run quickly sold out, and it is currently back-ordered on Amazon, where it occupies the number one slot on the best-seller list in the category of American biography. Wilder fans are a devoted breed, and there is nothing surprising about the book\u2019s popularity\u2014until you wade into it.\nMy greatest trouble this spring was that I couldn\u2019t get past the multiplication table at school. I just couldn\u2019t memorize it and we couldn\u2019t go on to arithmetic until we could say the multiplication table. Those who passed were going up stairs next terms and I would have to stay behind. So I was glad when Ma said she needed me to help her and I would have to stay out of school for a while.\nI helped Ma with the work, ran errands and every day worked sums in multiplication looking back at the multiplication table to help me when I couldn\u2019t remember.\nOne day when I came back from an errand that had taken me a long time, I found a new little sister.\nWilder desperately needed an editor, and luckily she had one\u2014if not something more. Rose Wilder Lane\u2019s astute and rigorous biographer, William Holtz, made a persuasive case, in \u201cThe Ghost in the Little House,\u201d that Lane was her mother\u2019s ghostwriter. She encouraged Wilder to recast the memoir as a series of \u201cjuveniles,\u201d and, in the course of a decade, they cannibalized, sanitized, and romanticized \u201cPioneer Girl\u201d for the \u201cLittle House\u201d books.", "gold_completion": " At least initially, however, it was Lane who shaped the narratives and polished the prose.\nPamela Smith Hill, the project leader and editor of \u201cPioneer Girl,\u201d is a prominent Wilder scholar, and a passionate advocate for her subject. In her introduction to the memoir, she acknowledges Lane\u2019s role as a midwife. But she also defends the integrity of Wilder\u2019s authorship against the slurs, as she sees them, of Holtz and others. It is difficult to reconcile Hill\u2019s perception of Wilder\u2019s \u201cevolution as a writer,\u201d her \u201cdescriptive genius,\u201d and her techniques for creating \u201ctension and suspense\u201d with the evidence of the manuscript. \u201cSome critics,\u201d she concludes, \u201chave charged that Wilder could not write.\u201d One has to agree with them.\nThe mother and daughter behind the Little House stories.", "no_wm_completion": " Their work\u2014and their motives (the money) are not an open question; we are forced now to wonder how much Wilder\u2019s life was changed for the worse.\n\u201cPioneer Girl\u201d opens with wild and impulsive Laura Ingalls Wilder and her young family, fleeing the Mississippi floods for the safety of their farm in Rocky Ridge, Missouri, in the fall of 1836. The book\u2019s title alludes to \u201cWilder Rose,\u201d the family dog, and a number of characters are introduced who play pivotal roles in the book as the Ingalls move upcountry with the onset of winter.\n\u201cWe were still in the midst of a long flood, which had washed away vast quantities of corn and grain, and the farm-furnishings and crops that had been so important to us,\u201d Wilder tells us, \u201cand we had become almost all destitute.\u201d There are echoes of the", "gen_completion": " The result is hard work\u2014the wild-boiled kind that makes a life\u2019s blood boil; the painstaking style, which can come slowly\u2014which may explain some people\u2019s surprise when one wonders whether you even really like Rose, or whether you think she has any business living in an old house full or chickens and milky pudding at three o\u2018clock midnight.

{"prefix": "Look out! There's an app barreling toward your skull, and it's going as fast as a car.\nAmong the most powerful things about the first iPhone was how it made old software metaphors \u2014 pressing buttons, scrolling through pages \u2014 much more literal. Scrolling was now linked, one-to-one, to the tip of your finger. You didn't click a button on a mouse to command a software cursor to press a button for you, you just tapped it with your thumb. This was a profound change and one that was hard to advertise or talk about. But it was something that users were able to grasp almost immediately.\nMovement in iOS, and in Android, is generally directly connected to one of two actions: a tapping or swiping, or hitting a button or dragging (or pushing!) something around. The weirdest these direct actions really get is pinch-to-zoom, which is somehow intuitive but doesn't really have a real-world equivalent. These are all vital in making iOS feel like iOS.\nAlso vital: the animations, which, in iOS 7, are centered around zooming. Or, more accurately, flying. Tapping an icon sends it flying at your face, at which point it begins to transform into an app. Closing it pulls it back away from you; it's as if the app is falling into the screen. Our minds take every other movement metaphor in iOS literally, but this one is weird. It feels three-dimensional in a way that others don't.\nThe sensation of depth is exaggerated in iOS 7, and profound enough that it led some users to complain of a sort of seasickness (which Apple both acknowledged and provided a fix for, in an update).\nI used the small-angle approximation since the size of the object (in this case the app) is significantly smaller than the distance from which you are observing it. This allowed us to assume that the apparent size of the object is inversely proportional to the distance from which you are observing it.\nIn order for an iPhone app to appear to be the width of an iPhone icon, it would have to be about 5.33 feet away. That is to say, if iOS animations suggest that the icons are falling away from you, they are falling about 5 feet, and moving pretty fast. Assuming it takes about 0.8 seconds for this animation to complete, the app is moving at an average of about 6.6 feet per second, or about 4.5 miles per hour: a slow jogging speed.\nThose 19.29 feet are traveled, again, in about 0.8 seconds, which works out to a little more than 24.1 feet per second, or 16.4 miles per hour. That's an average too \u2014 the animation accelerates then decelerates. Or", "gold_completion": " at least it looks that way. It seems probably that, at its top speed, this icon is flying at or away from your face at over 20 miles per hour.\nKind of casts that motion-sickness stuff in a new light! iOS 7 certainly hints more strongly at depth than iOS 6, in which the zooming felt less physical. It was more like expansion than zooming, a closer relative to pinch-to-resize.\nUpdate: Developer Steve Streza provides some background, on Twitter: \"Those animations are based on spring physics. So it's like you stretched a spring from you to the folder and then let go... Animations pre-iOS 7 were based on sine wave curves. iOS 7 animations have a more gradual decay.\" Thanks Steve!\nAnyway, now you know why iOS 7 doesn't just look different, it feels different: Every time you close an app to a folder, you're hurling it about 25 feet away from your face.", "no_wm_completion": ", more precisely, accelerates (the animation is always redrawn every second; we are in a zoom-in mode), decelerates (the timer resets every few seconds) and accelerates again.\nFor you math majors, you can use that 24.1-foot per second velocity to calculate 20 percent of 21.8 miles per hour, or 14.8 miles per hour. That sounds pretty fast, but it's actually pretty slow for iPhone applications. That's a whole world away from the average speed of a typical human body: running a marathon might take somewhere between 5 and 7 hours to run, but for most people it's going to be a mere 17 minutes or so.\nFor this reason, this type of animation is not common on iOS. It's one of the more prominent non-interactive gestures. But some folks still like it, so maybe we should keep it available, even if it's just to indicate that the app is sliding toward your face.", "gen_completion": " perhaps you'd describe this more as a zippy jog than a speed walk? The way iPhones handle app icons means how quick it takes an icon in actual time, versus the time in animation (and this makes an adjustment).\nIn order, then for an icon or screen image on your home or work iPhone screenshake to appear 1.2 feet from the top left corner at which you are watching, or 0 inches above your desk screen or other iPhone screenshake indicator, would depend how far back on your work iPhone screenshake indicator that the above rule, or something like, needed to appear. Or is it that the higher (and faster moving, of the two options just listed), one stands above your desk screen or other iPhone screenshake indicator, indicating how far back the lower, non-interactive, speeds need have to appear for it to appear 1.2 feet from the top left corner?

The company had broadly covered that prohibition in its previous standards, but decided it was worth explaining a little more deeply in the new format. Facebook has also broken out a section detailing \"Attacks on Public Figures.\"\nBickert said that the company wanted to keep the language as simple as possible since the community standards are universal across the company's approximately 1.3 billion users -- covering Facebookers of all ages, on all platforms and in all of the countries where the network reaches.

{"prefix": "Looking at your Facebook page may help you accept criticism and weather attacks on your ego, a study suggests.\nThat time you're spending on Facebook may not be wasted productivity, after all.\nAt least, that's what yet another Facebook-based study has found.\nYou may remember Stuart Smiley, the fey self-affirmation addict portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live\" by now-Sen. Al Franken. He stares into the mirror and declares, \"I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and, dog gone it, people like me.\"\nThat's what Facebook does, according to a study published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.\nWe already know that looking at other people's fun times on Facebook could make you envious. And we've seen that you are what you like on Facebook \u2014 a computer algorithm based on \"likes\" can home in on such things as sexual orientation, political leanings and psychological traits including openness and conscientiousness.\nSo, think of your Facebook page as Stuart Smiley's mirror: It contains a lot of your core beliefs and preferences, and it puts your network of friends and family at your reach. In psychologist language, it can \"satisfy fundamental ego needs regarding desired self-images.\"\nYou can't directly measure any Facebook bump in self-esteem or any bump generated other ways. But you can measure defensive behavior to criticism. It's been shown that the self-affirmation experiences similar to those spoofed by Stuart Smiley reduce defensive responses that are naturally elicited by ego threats.\nPsychologists have tested this repeatedly. Usually they ask a participant to list strongly held beliefs and write an essay about the top one. After that, the participant invariably reacts better to a blow against the ego. The essay acts as self-affirmation.\nThe participant who chooses to write about a lower-ranked value but about how others may think it's important generally is more defensive. The essay had no self-affirming effect.\nTurns out, looking at your own Facebook page is the social network equivalent of that first essay. Looking at another person's page is the non-affirming experience.\nCatalina Toma, at the University of Wisconsin, and Jeffrey Hancock, at Cornell, study communication and social networks. They devised two experiments. In the first, some students got to look at their own Facebook page, while others looked at a stranger's page (it turned out to be another study participant's page). Some wrote the self-affirming essay, while others wrote the more neutral one.\nNow the ruse: Participants were told they were there to evaluate a distance-learning public speaking course. Each was to write a short speech on the legality of abortion and deliver it to a camera, then get feedback and rate the feedback by various aspects. The trick: Participants wound up with the same negative feedback.\nWhat happened? Results were as expected: less defensive response from people exposed to self-affirmation activity; more from those who did not get that experience. And it turned out that the proportion between those two responses was the same for those who wrote the essays as for those who viewed Facebook pages.\n\u201cFacebook has just as big an effect on self-esteem as traditional tools,\u201d Hancock said.\nBut would someone who gets a negative feedback actively seek solace in Facebook? The second experiment tested that. They used a similar cover story: testing a public speaking program. But this time feedback was randomly negative or neutral. After the feedback, participants were allowed to choose an activity: looking at their own Facebook page, watching YouTube videos, listening to online music, reading online news or playing online video games.\nAfter receiving neutral feedback, participants were equally likely to choose any of", "gold_completion": " those activities. About 30% chose Facebook. But nearly twice as many chose Facebook after negative feedback.\nWell, maybe more people prefer Facebook over the other activities, right? Researchers took that into account.\nFacebook's rank among the activity choices (tested before the experiment) for those who got negative feedback was lower than the average rating of the other activities.\nWhy would any of this be important? Well, it gives experimenters a new tool to use instead of the essay, and there are about a billion people who use Facebook in any given month. That's a gigantic laboratory.\nBut Facebook might one day be part of therapies that use self-affirmation, such as programs to quit smoking or to change other habits.\n\u201cAnything you need to be stronger at, self-affirmation is good for you,\u201d Hancock said.\nMaybe you'll find that you're good enough, smart enough and, dog gone it, people press the like icon on your posts.", "no_wm_completion": " the three in response to a negative feedback-exposure. What's more, self-affirmation also reduced defensive reactions to all types of feedback, although defensive responses dropped when people got the experience that they knew was an illusion even though it felt real.\nSo the theory is this: If the experience of liking your Facebook walls was real, it was still possible to use it as a form of self-affirmation, but it may well suppress or diminish defensive reactions when it comes to negative feedback.\nThe findings may be a way to explain why one of the most popular social networks has become so divisive and polarizing over time.\nSocial networks have become more pervasive. We use them for friendships, relationships and jobs. We look at others' posts and profile pictures when we want to feel better about ourselves. We share status updates. But some of us are starting to question whether we really care and should we even be on Facebook at all.\n\"Social media has increased our feelings of", "gen_completion": " the activities in order, or (at most) one.

There could be funky stuff going on in the computer system, and I would never know why.\"\nWhat makes this one so bad? It's a computer bug that runs especially deep in the machine.\nAll computers have some kind of basic input/output system (BIOS), the core program that brings a machine to life.

{"prefix": "Recently, I was gifted with a little bottle of blessed oil brought from an orthodox monastery in Greece. The aroma of this blessed oil is powerful, profound and, yes, mystical.\nObviously, when I say mystical, I am not talking about esotericism. The joint document, entitled \"Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of life: A Christian reflection on the 'New Age'\" issued by the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Council for interreligious Dialogue, describes it as \"a search for knowledge, and magic, or the occult\". On the contrary, what is mystical is revealed because it is not the theoretical knowledge for the chosen few but holiness as the everyday bread and butter for every person. As Jesus himself tells us: \"Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven \"(Matt 5:19). Therefore, Christian mysticism is about being great and not being small. It is about being authentic and not fake by placing oneself above others.\nThe bible teaching which tells us that you and me, thanks to Jesus' Spirit in us that we received both at our baptism and at our confirmation, lives in us, is found in Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians. Here Paul says: \"But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?\" (2 Cor 2:14-16).\nBoth Jesus Christ and Satan have their aroma. The aroma of Jesus Christ is \"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control\" (Gal 5:22-23). Moreover, the Bible tells us that Christ's aroma is also compassion, \"kindness, lowliness, meekness, ... patience, ... forgive[ness], ... perfect harmony,... love,... thankful[ness], teach[ing], admonish[ing] one another,... do[ing] everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, [and] giving thanks to God the Father through him\" (Col 3:12-17).\nAlmost every person I anoint and pray over with this blessed oil tells me: \"Father! What a nice smell this oil has!\" You are hundred per cent right my dear brother and sister! Because, if you and I carry within our hearts love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, patience, forgiveness, perfect harmony, thankfulness, teaching, admonishing one another gently, doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus and giving thanks to God the Father through Him we certainly smell beautiful. The reason is that it is no longer our weak smell of sin that we carry in our hearts but Christ's fragrance. And, when you and I let God's Spirit live in us and cultivate within us these holy and beloved attitudes then Jesus can look at us and say to us personally: \"How sweet is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice\" (Cant 4:10).\nYes!

Because Satan's aroma is eternally destructive, the Bible lovingly warns us to keep away from it: \"those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God\" (Gal 5:21).\nWhen you meet me, especially at Mater Dei as I visit patients, their families, hospital staff and going round the hospital following the example of the Merciful Shepherd, remind me to anoint you with this aromatic oil, place my consecrated hands on you and pray that you too be transformed by Christ's aroma.", "no_wm_completion": " important than any of our old habits, our old sins, our old worries, problems or failures.

These calls created a number of patient care problems and strained hospital ER services.\nCommunity paramedicine is designed to address these issues. Numerous articles and studies cite the overall benefits of this model, showing how in the long run, non-emergency patients need fewer trips to the ER.\nHowever, ER services are again under stress due to the current nationwide opioid crisis. Emergency medical services must respond to countless overdose calls that burden EMS workers and take away necessary resources from other emergencies.\nA recent study shows that many overdose patients do not get the care that they need to break the cycle, even after one or more emergency trips to a medical facility. However, an interesting new measure has emerged that meets the need to help drug overdose patients.\nAccording to Dan Swayze, community paramedicine can be used to monitor opioid-addicted patients detoxing at home. Swayze says a couple of cities are starting to use this model, which could be a boon to the community and potentially reduce the number of opioid-related drug overdoses.\nEmergency medical services will continue to change as the needs of local municipalities change. Community paramedicine is definitely changing the way EMS agencies are reacting to opioid overdoses. If community paramedicine is widely used to monitor addicts at home, it may prove to be a tremendous asset in breaking the opioid epidemic cycle.\nAllison G. S.

Now, in the 21st century, dedication to harnessing top-of-the-line technology is even more necessary.\nWe live in a post 9/11 society.

They also knew, as we know today, that one of the realities of having these freedoms is that there will always be individuals who want to take them from us. To lack vigilance in our investment in national security fails a central tenet of our constitutional duty \u2013 outlined in the first sentence of the Constitution \u2013 to provide for the common defense.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that reconciling defense spending with our rapidly increasing national debt and deficit is a big task.

However, we cannot use the national debt as an excuse to jeopardize our national security. Washington can \u2013 and must \u2013 get its fiscal house in order without cheapening our national security.\nToday, the danger of eroding our defense budget stretches beyond the battlefield.

She met the sushi chef she calls her \u201cadopted father\u201d almost twenty years later, working as a substitute waitress at his Upper East Side restaurant in 2013.\nOguma could be a strict teacher at times, but Tempest \u2014 a Massachusetts native who moved to New York to study art but today serves chef-curated omakase meals under the name Sushi by Bae \u2014 admired his passion and principles: \u201cHis philosophy was just focus on sushi, just focus on your work. That was really beautiful to me as an artist,\u201d she said.\nTempest\u2019s gender and Jewish heritage made her an unlikely apprentice. Still, Oguma instructed her in not only the art of making sushi, but more practical matters: how to save money, by conserving plastic wrap for example, and how to stand up to suppliers selling fish beneath her standards.\nNamed one of Zagat\u2019s \u201c30 under 30 rock stars\u201d redefining the restaurant industry in New York City in 2016, Tempest struck out on her own, working for a brief time at the now two Michelin-starred Sushi Ginza Onodera. Earlier this year, she partnered up with friend and fellow sushi chef David Bouhadana to offer at his Gansevoort Market sushi counter her own 90-minute, four-seat $100 omakase experience. She\u2019s brought that Sushi by Bae concept to Bouhadana\u2019s new Sushi by Bou spot at the Jue Lan Club, a posh Chinese eatery in the Flatiron District.\n1. She moved to New York to study art at the School of Visual Arts, where her thesis involved sushi.\n2. She considers herself an artist whose medium is food, rather than a chef.\nIn addition to shaping rice, she added, \u201cThere are artful ways to score the fish that make it fold more aesthetically over the rice than [other ways].\u201d Tempest pays close attention to the way her sushi looks when it\u2019s served, so she\u2019s developed her own techniques for cutting fish to present it from its best angle.\n3. As Tempest sees it, there\u2019s a lot more to sushi than cutting and molding fish.\n4. She specializes in edomae-style sushi, which involves a lot of curing.\nLiterally, \u201cedomae\u201d translates into \u201cin front of Tokyo\u201d; figuratively, it refers to fish from the city\u2019s bay and abstractly, \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that sushi chefs philosophize", "gold_completion": " over, like what is the meaning of art,\u201d Tempest said.\nIllness ultimately cut short her training under the \u201cremarkable chef\u201d Masaki Saito, she said.\n6.

This developer however contributed $200,000 for a future center. Over the years, the gift funds grew to nearly $500,000, and before the assets were reallocated, the equestrians rode their horses to City Hall, with some of the miniature horses making their whinnies heard at the Council Chamber\u2019s podium.\nTheir peaceful demonstration gave notice to the City Council, which selected an equestrian committee made up of representatives from various equestrian groups to look into the operations and needs of developing a world-class equestrian center, and to select areas where the equestrian center could be located.\nSue Leto, director of Parks and Recreation, led the appointed Equestrian Committee in several meetings as the group elected to designate the equestrian park as a first-class facility that would compliment the Community Center and the Tommy Lasorda Jr. Field House. The equestrian committee envisioned a resource that would be desirable for weddings, banquets and community gatherings, as well as a boarding, training and learning facility, a Class A show facility and a therapeutic riding center.\nSeveral sites were walked by the committee.

{"prefix": "There was much to be disappointed by in President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview over the weekend, from his curious belief that climate change might reverse itself to his contention that his mocking of alleged sexual assault victim Christine Blasey Ford is immaterial now that \u201cwe won\u201d and Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court. But there\u2019s at least one thing he said that ought to disturb Americans right in their core beliefs. Asked about the apparent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, President Trump vowed \u201csevere punishment\u201d if it turns out that Saudi Arabia ordered his death, but he expressed great reluctance to use the most powerful leverage available to him \u2014 the pending $110 billion arms sale to that country \u2014 on the grounds it would hurt U.S. manufacturers.\nSo there it is. The price of justice has been set. Do at least $110 billion worth of business with a favored industry within the United States and human rights are meaningless. Truth is meaningless. Once again, the Saudi royal family is demonstrating to the world that everyone has a price. The values that Americans claim to hold dear are actually negotiable when contracts and jobs are on the line. No wonder China and Russia and other regimes with questionable human rights records want to do business with the U.S. We are a paper tiger made from greenbacks. Lock us into enormously valuable contracts, and we\u2019ll purr like kittens.\nMight it be too early to judge the Trump administration morally bankrupt when the matter hasn\u2019t been fully investigated? Perhaps. But President Trump doesn\u2019t exactly have a sterling record for investigations, given the FBI\u2019s recent whitewash of Professor Ford\u2019s alleged teen encounter with Judge Kavanaugh, neither of whom federal gumshoes could be bothered to interview. What similar treatment is waiting for the case of the missing Washington Post columnist? Rounding up the usual suspects? Blaming MS-13? You don\u2019t have to be a Democrat to be appalled by this administration\u2019s tolerance of Saudi misconduct. Congressional Republicans are grumbling about the response, too \u2014 including Sen. Marco Rubio who was on TV Sunday saying neither Saudi money nor its occasional help reining in Iran should cause the U.S. to lose sight of its role as a defender of morality and human rights.\nIndeed, congressional action may ultimately be the only way to be certain a serious punishment is meted out against the Saudis \u2014 much as it took Congress to force the administration to keep pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin. Mr. Trump\u2019s loyalties often seem to run toward making money and not toward defending this nation\u2019s ideals. He\u2019s only too willing to risk economic success in trade wars. He\u2019ll take that gamble in the name of greater economic success. But standing up for free speech? That\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to be in the Trump DNA.

Not just because he was a harsh critic of the Saudi government but because there are many more Jamal Khashoggis out there writing and reporting on the terrible things other countries and other regimes are perpetrating against their citizens. If the U.S. and its allies are willing to look the other way in this case, even slightly, what is to keep all those other despots from doing the same? Earlier this month, we got the answer when the body of 30-year-old Viktoria Marinova was fished out of the Danube.

It would not be taking the words of Mr. Trump himself at face value, after he told CBS News\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that Khashoggi was \u201cbadguy\u201d and \u201cdid it.\u201d Nor would it be trying to persuade Congress to keep pressure off Saudi Arabia.

{"prefix": "Back in the mid-1990s, I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, then vice president at IBM, who was charged with building a new generation of supercomputers. But Dr. Wladawsky-Berger didn't go out and spend a huge budget on specialized hardware. Rather, the genius of his approach was to take sets of already-manufactured processors -- at the time, RISC processors from IBM's Unix family -- and lashed them together with a high-speed switch to create supercomputing power. A few years later, the follow-on generation of supercomputers was built in a similar fashion from x86 processors running Linux.\nWelcome to innovation, 21st Century style. A couple of months ago, I posted some observations about innovation coming from low-cost and conveniently available parts -- part of the formula for success for our era: \u201cGood enough\u201d may be good enough when it comes to developing new products and services.\nOne powerful byproduct that has emerged from this paradigm is supercomputers. The latest and fastest behemoth, as a matter of fact, was built from PC chips from Advanced Micro Devices. The supercomputer, as described by The New York Times' Ashlee Vance, runs at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee \"and can throw hundreds of thousands of processing engines at computing problems.\"\n\"The supercomputing world was long dominated by systems that required specialized chips, memory systems and networking technology. But about 10 years ago,", "gold_completion": " researchers realized they could link thousands of cheaper machines running on mainstream chips and achieve pretty solid performance.\"\nThe idea that many small commodity processors could work together to provide supercomputing power is being seen in other forms, such as grids. For example, the SETI@home project employs individual users across the globe, who donate unused cycles to help sift through data in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\nThe Top500 list of the world's current top 500 supercomputers was just released, and just about all are built with commonly available commodity processors. In fact, 79% of the world's fastest supercomputers run on clusters of Intel EM64T processors.\nAcross all product categories, the high-end brands, typically offered as part of well-crafted and expensive interdependent architectures, will be displaced by more modular approaches offered by commoditizers. In the process, new markets will open as more companies or people have access to more affordable approaches.

The biggest challenge has been to develop an appropriate framework for integrating this kind of low-cost, easy-to-install kit with high-performance compute systems.\nThe basic elements of the Open Compute Project platform are an open storage platform (X.25) that has been implemented on supercomputing hardware and a simple network (Nebulas) that has been implemented on commercial network gear to create a \"transparent hybrid\" infrastructure.\n\"As far as the technical strategy for scaling these resources, we use a strategy that works very well", "gen_completion": " computer processors became the fastest and most flexible components that let researchers and scientists collaborate on new work faster and easier.

{"prefix": "Warminster, Pa. - THE horticultural world is having its own debate over immigration, with some environmentalists warning about the dangers of so-called exotic plants from other countries and continents \"invading\" American gardens. These botanical xenophobes say that a pristine natural state exists in our yards and that to disturb it is both sinful and calamitous. In their view, exotic plants will swallow your garden, your neighbors' gardens and your neighbors' neighbors' gardens until the ecosystem collapses under their rampant suffocating growth.\nIf anything suffocates us, though, it will be the environmentalists' narrowmindedness. Like all utopian visions, their dream beckons us into a perfect and rational natural world where nothing ever changes -- a world that never existed and never will.\nNative plants are the survivalists of the botanical world, and in the appropriate settings -- wilderness areas, home and botanical gardens, public parks and sidewalks -- they bless us with their beauty and awe us with their tenacity. Our lives would be poor and grim without the strawberry, cranberry, columbine and trillium. They've always been here, in the same way that Native Americans have been; only their arrival and settlement are more ancient.\nLike human survivalists, natives are also subject to exploitation by the horticultural equivalent of radical fundamentalists. The anti-exotics argue that gardens should be populated exclusively by native plants, as if the exotics were trying to enter the flower bed illegally. The consequences of such a stand could be dire. Should we eat no onions or garlic, apples or lemons; feast our eyes on no magnificent tulips or roses -- all exotics of Eurasian origin? Should Asians not enjoy their distinctive peppers, tomatoes, beans, squash, sunflowers and corn -- all from the Americas?\nIndeed, the world's most popular root crop, potatoes, started life as a staple of the Andean people and achieved its first international fame as a slave food. By the time it reached France, the \"earth apple\" was a delicacy likened to truffles; their flowers were featured in tiaras of court ladies. Exotic indeed.\nShould we deprive ourselves of petunias, begonias, impatiens and hollyhocks -- not a one of them \"native\"? Must we, on pain of being cast out of the garden as horticultural pariahs, deny the elephant his peanuts? This wouldn't be merely ridiculous. It would compare with the denial of human immigration on grounds that certain ethnic groups breed in numbers \"too prolific\" for the existing elite to tolerate. Imagine, then, a horticultural ruling class. No \"invasives\" need apply: let the lily find another valley.

{"prefix": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi is probably the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, but that doesn't mean it's without its faults. From the over the top barrage of humor to some certain things that made fans laugh or cry at the wrong time, we've collected some of the biggest gripes with Rian Johnson's first foray into the Star Wars universe. While they're not horrible offenses, they've for some reason or another left a bad taste in the mouths of fans, much like the weird green milk Luke Skywalker ingested on Ahch-To from that weird alien sea cow. Brace yourselves, there are SPOILERS AHEAD, so if you haven't seen The Last Jedi, you might want to stop reading.\nOne of the worst things about The Last Jedi are the Canto Bight scenes. They seem out of place, almost like George Lucas directed them and had the scenes patched into the movie without telling anybody. From a weird drunken space leprechaun feeding BB-8 gold coins to some of the lamest inhabitants of any alien planet in the Star Wars universe. It is definitely the bathroom break portion of the movie with the only saving grace being the introduction of Benicio del Toro's DJ character into the fold. Elsewhere, the Fathiers have weird almost human-like faces to prove how sad they are while some poor orphan kids clean up after them. Never mind BB-8 shooting gold coins out of himself like a bizarre machine gun. The whole scene that leads to Canto Bight turning into the nightmare of the movie is undoubtedly the parking violation. Rose and Finn get arrested for a Parking ticket? This can't be real and it truly looks like George Lucas wrote that into the script because it reeks of his style. Those fans griping that Lucas isn't represented in The Last Jedi, look no further than 2 main characters getting arrested for a parking violation at a casino. It's just plain lazy and not even humorous, except to maybe George Lucas.\nCaptain Phasma was promised to be a bigger character in The Last Jedi and she clearly was not. She's barely in the movie and when she is on the screen for a substantial amount of time, she apparently dies and we get to see her eye. There's no big reveal and she doesn't even seem as tough as she does in The Force Awakens, which basically means that she's another throwaway character who does all of the press and promotion for the movie, but is barely on the screen.\nAnother gripe about The Last Jedi is the lack of background on Supreme Leader Snoke. J.J. Abrams built the leader of the First Order to be this huge deal and Andy Serkis was telling anybody that would listen that the villainous alien is more powerful than Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. While Snoke looks amazing and Serkis' portrayal of the character is commanding, the dude gets cut in half by Kylo Ren, really easily too. So here's this big bad villain that everybody has been wondering about for 2 years and now nothing. Just cut in half with no mention of anything else.\nOk, so this might be a bit controversial, but Leia using the Force to get", "gold_completion": " back to the ship after floating in space was a bit over the top.

George Lucas has reportedly told Rian Johnson that he can redo the scene in 20 years and re-release it into theaters along with some other touchups.\nSpeaking of controversy, some fans believe that the absence of Jar Jar Binks actually made The Last Jedi worse. No kidding, fans have taken to social media and bemoaned the fact that Jar Jar didn't return and save the movie from what, we just don't know. This is a real complaint about the movie and it isn't immediately understood, so we'll just let that simmer for a while and come back to it a little later.", "no_wm_completion": " Rey to stop the First Order and save the galaxy is just weird.

Now with Rey learning to be on the Force, does she not realize that there is something more sinister at work on a galactic scale that everyone has been looking for? It feels out of place that Rey would be using their mystical power to pull the Falcon out of the sky and then fly out of there like there was nothing happening in the background. That's not how Force works. If you want Rey to be that super force user that can save the galaxy, put her through hard training.

It just wasn\u2019t scalable. \u201cPeople really don\u2019t buy that way, even when they say they will,\u201d he says. \u201cThey like to buy their meat in trusted places where it\u2019s stored cold \u2013 grocery stores and butcher shops.\u201d The other problem was that farms don\u2019t do business that way either \u2013 they don\u2019t deliver their meat throughout the city because they simply don\u2019t have time. Getting into the consumer market would mean turning into a supply chain company, Jones realized, and he didn\u2019t want that.\nInstead, he looked to who were the biggest buyers of meats, and decided to enable them. Here in the U.S., that\u2019s the distributor businesses which sells to the retailers. There are a number of these businesses which are independent (meaning not under contract from larger distributors like Monsanto or Cargill), but still fairly good-sized companies. Through AgLocal, they\u2019ll be able to connect with and buy directly from the farmers. And in the end, AgLocal could still offer consumers a mobile solution that lets them know where in their city they can find the locally raised, sustainable meats.\n\u201cSustainable,\u201d although not the original inspiration for the business, is a key part of AgLocal\u2019s potential.

And then they would only get a small piece of margin for three to four times the work.

But farmers don\u2019t have time to sell, says Jones, they\u2019re operators.\nBesides the impact to farmers\u2019 margins, mechanized farming contributes to a whole host of problems: pollution, what they do to the meat we consume because of overcrowding issues and the antibiotics pumped into the animals, and, ultimately, what they do to our healthcare costs because of the meat we consume.

{"prefix": "\"Breaking Bad\" spinoff \"Better Call Saul\" is coming to TV in Feb. and it's probably one of the most-anticipated new series of the year.\nWe've already seen it, and \"Breaking Bad\" fans should really enjoy it.\nSo it shouldn't be a big surprise the series has already been renewed for a second season.\nIf you can't wait for \"Better Call Saul,\" but need to know a bit more before the show's premiere, here's everything you need to know about the spinoff.\nIs this a prequel or a sequel?\nThe majority of the series is set in 2002, six years before Saul ever met Walter White. However, the show definitely has some elements of a sequel, too, as viewers will see in the premiere's first frew minutes.\nSo, yes, you'll get to see what became of Saul Goodman after he left Walt and Jesse Pinkman.\nWhen we spoke with Odenkirk a while back while he was doing press for his Oscar-nominated film \"Nebraska,\" the star told us he wanted the show to be both a prequel and sequel. It looks like he got his wish.\nWho will star in the spinoff?\nJonathan Banks will reprise his role as Mike Ehrmantraut.\nMichael McKean will play Saul's older brother Chuck who is a partner at a law firm in Albuquerque.\nPatrick Fabian plays Howard Hamlin while Rhea Seehorn (\"Whitney\") stars as Kim, two lawyers at Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill.\nMichael Mando (\"Orphan Black\") plays a criminal named Nacho Varga.\nSo, what will this be about?\nThe show will follow Saul Goodman before he's the cocky, confident lawyer, when he's just known as Jimmy McGill.\nMcGill's strapped for cash and drives a rundown car. He's trying to make a living as an honest attorney. What should follow in the series is how McGill goes from a scrappy, hungry young lawyer to a well-known name in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nWhy did Saul get his own spinoff?\nThe show has been in the works for a while in the \"Breaking Bad\" writers room. Creator Vince Gilligan told Hitfix it kind of started off as a joke.\nIt started as a lark, which is another word for joke, in the writer's room. It started and it really came from the fact that I love working with Bob, just as we love working with really every actor on \"Breaking Bad.\" But we also loved the character. We love writing for the character. We love putting words in his mouth. And we had so much fun indeed doing that that it started as a lark; we'd come up with some great term or phrase and we'd laugh about it in the writer's room. And then we'd say, 'You know, when we're doing the Saul Goodman show we'll be able to blah, blah, blah, blah.' And we made that comment so many times that it started to dawn on us that it wasn't a lark; there was truth to it. It was not just a joke, but a potentially good idea.\nIf I like \"Breaking Bad,\" will I enjoy it?\nI think you will. From what I've seen in the first two episodes (I'm waiting out to watch the third at the moment), there are plenty of nods to the original series while not feeling forced.\nYou'll see a few familiar faces including Jonathan Banks, and the visuals and montages will feel straight out of \"Breaking Bad.\"\nHowever, don't go into this show wanting another \"Breaking", "gold_completion": " Bad.\" You'll be disappointed.

{"prefix": "A system that aims to identify stolen passwords before breaches are reported or even detected was launched on Tuesday.\nShape Security's Blackfish credential defence system is designed to detect the use of stolen usernames and passwords by criminals and in real time.\nThe technology is a mechanism for organisations to identify the abuse of stolen passwords and attempts to hijack accounts long before these same purloined credentials show up for sale on the dark web.\nCybercrooks regularly automate the process of testing stolen or leaked passwords on third-party websites.\nFor example, customers of online takeaway firm Deliveroo found their accounts hijacked and charged for food they never ordered because of a credential-stuffing attack. In another attack using the same method, passwords and email addresses from previous breaches were abused to gain access to 26,000 online UK National Lottery accounts. Groupon blamed fraudulent purchases from some UK customers' accounts on password leaks from other sites.\nCredential stuffing only works because many users still use the same login details on multiple sites. This is a serious security risk that's only getting worse as the volume of data breaches rises.\nShape Security's network data shows that in many industries, such as retail, more than 90 per cent of all login attempts to websites often come from credential-stuffing attacks instead of genuine users.\nShape Security's customer base includes three of the top-four banks, four of the top-five airlines, two of the top-five hotel chains, and two of the top-five US government agencies. Crowdsourcing alerts about brute-force credential-stuffing attacks among its customers makes for an effective early warning system, the firm claims.\nCTO and former Google clickfraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder told El Reg: \"Cybercriminal organizations are businesses, and they need an ROI, so it just doesn't make sense for them to go after smaller websites with credential-stuffing campaigns. Over the last five years, Shape has created and deployed technology to protect the login systems of the major banks, airlines, retailers, and other industries where cybercriminals first use stolen credentials to take over accounts.\n\"So in this case there isn't much of a 'long tail' associated with the attack data, since cybercriminal activity is concentrated in the high end of the market.\"\nFacebook, Twitter and other companies have been researching the dark web for several years, acquiring lists of stolen credentials to protect their users. \"This can be helpful but its utility is limited,\" said Gh", "gold_completion": "osemajumder. \"Darknet-sourced lists of stolen credentials tend to have much less value compared to credentials which have been recently stolen, which sophisticated cybercriminals first use against leading consumer sites, such as those that Shape protects.\"\nShape's credential defence technology ultimately aims to end credential-stuffing attacks by making stolen data worthless to cybercriminals.

That\u2019s not to say chocolate will produce the same \u201chigh\u201d as marijuana, but there may be a chemical basis for the pleasure we get from eating chocolate.\n\u201cA chocolate chip cookie is a brilliant contrast among the flavors and among the textures,\u201d said Gail Vance Civille, founder and president of Sensory Spectrum, a consulting firm that helps companies learn how sensory cues drive consumer perceptions of products.\nThe flavor of chocolate chip cookies, according to Civille, is \u201ca beautiful amalgam of caramelized butter and sugar,\u201d the result of the browning of butter and caramelizing of sugar while it bakes. The combination of the toasted grain with the browned butter, caramelized sugar, vanilla and chocolate are \u201cthe beautiful rich flavors that blend together in a chocolate chip cookie,\u201d she said. And as the chocolate melts, it becomes more aromatic and punches up the flavor.\nThe texture of chocolate chip cookies also plays a big role in their appeal. \u201cJust on the texture side, [the chocolate chip cookie] has a lot going for it,\u201d Civille said.\n\u201cEvery bite will be interesting. \u2026 You will hit the cookie, which has crispness due to air pockets in the cookie crumb, and then the chocolate, which is dense and uniform when you bite through it. It\u2019s like a symphony orchestra playing together. \u2026 It\u2019s very harmonious,\u201d she said.\nOne of the simplest ways to test whether the flavor and texture of chocolate chip cookies are \u201caddictive enough\u201d is to observe people eating them.\n\u201cWhen I would create any product, if I put it out as a sample to my staff", "gold_completion": " and if I didn\u2019t watch them unconsciously go back and take some more, then I felt it wasn\u2019t good enough.

I wanted that addictive thing,\u201d King said.\nThe optimal ratio of chocolate chips to cookie is also a personal preference. \u201cI\u2019ll put a bag on the table, and my husband will turn them over and look for the least amount of chips, but I\u2019ll look for the most,\u201d King said.\nWhatever one\u2019s individual chocolate chip cookie preference \u2014 or \u201caddiction\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s fair to say that these beloved cookies can have a place in a balanced diet, as long as you are willing to keep portions in check.\nSo whether it feels like a true \u201caddiction\u201d or not, indulging in a chocolate chip cookie or two should be a happy experience.", "no_wm_completion": ", they would go through it.

So they would start eating right into the batch.\u201d People who get to the end will always buy the cookie and go through the whole batch, she said.\nThat\u2019s what happened with Vance Civille\u2019s husband. He said when he got a sample of her product, he immediately ate a bite of the first cookie and never stopped. His experience was unusual, but he later learned that people often feel a deep attraction to chocolate.

This possibility explains the considerable interest shown by such companies as Exxon and Arco now engaged in exporatory work off the Argentine coast. It also is one reason political analysts give for the tenacity of both British and Argentine claims to the Falklands.\nA second opinion, supported by recent work done for the US Department of Energy by the US Geological Survey, says that Argentina's oil-rich sedimentary beds both onshore and offshore may end well before reaching the midway point between Argentina and the Falklands.\nThe oil industry can only resolve the question of the Falklands' oil potential by drilling exploratory wells. Preliminary steps have been taken but the major work remains ahead. According to some experts, the combination of extreme weather conditions in the Falklands area and current low crude oil prices could delay further work for as much as 20 years. Other experts see production possible in the area within five to seven years -- if the British and Argentinians resolve their political differences.\nThree years ago, before British-Argentine relations soured, the countries jointly licensed seismic surveys.

Offshore, he says, this same layer is up to 180 meters thick and laced with oil and gas.\nOther petroleum geologists say it is far too early even to guess at whether oil may be found under the Falkland Islands. Dr. Albert W. Bally, former chief geologist for Shell Oil Company and now chairman of Rice University's geology department, however, sees a clear ''oil incentive'' behind Argentina's attempt to reclaim the Falklands.\nAccording to a petroleum expert at the World Bank, the possibility of oil riches is very attractive to Argentina.\n''With internal economic and political problems the government is naturally going to take action to divert public attention away from these problems,'' he says.", "no_wm_completion": " the wells in place.\nOne of the reasons, no doubt, for the lack of action now is that there is enough untapped potential offshore to offset any shortfall at the current time.

In addition, it may be possible under certain circumstances that seismic surveys could be conducted and samples taken without the islands, but in a controlled manner.\nSuch a method might prove more useful in Antarctica, where the waters are more temperate. Yet, at the same time, for reasons of sovereignty, the Falkland Islands are governed separately.\nIn the early 1980s, when the issue of the islands was being debated in London parliament, the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, made it clear that the islands will not be ceded to any foreign nation.

For persons who we would entrust our very lives and safety with, there is the need to have established their psychological state.\nResilience is a very important asset that every security person must necessarily possess. Even though there is no art to tell the mind's construction in the face, as Shakespeare tells us, we are fortunate to have psychological tests that can determine one's state, and the potential to withstand or crumble under stress or provocation.\nThe line between sanity and insanity is so thin that most of us at one time or the other cross over to the other side.

{"prefix": "Council Post: Can Advertisers Balance Scale And Quality?\nCan Advertisers Balance Scale And Quality?\nFounder and CEO of Taykey, a real-time audience data company.\nIn the wake of several high-profile cases of large advertisers appearing next to terrorist videos, the issues of inventory quality and safety are once again top of mind for the advertising industry. We\u2019re seeing a renewed flight to manually vetted solutions such as private ad exchanges, predefined publisher whitelists and traditional direct media deals where marketers run exclusively on hand-selected publishers.\nUnfortunately, advertisers also pay the price in the form of reduced scale, efficiency, and the ability to reach and engage their consumers most effectively. While the appeal of these manual approaches is understandable, their trade-offs are often unnecessary based on the advertiser\u2019s objectives. Increasingly, whitelisting and private exchanges are being used as a crutch for bad data and inaccurate targeting rather than a proactive strategy.\nThe primary challenge is consumer behavior itself. More than 30% of web traffic is driven by social media. Millennials check their phones more than 150 times per day, jumping from social platforms to articles to videos. Most of this phone time is \u201clife in the feed,\u201d where discovery reigns supreme and social conversation is driving consumption. As a result, the new prime time looks less like \"M*A*S*H*\" and more like Joseph Garrett (aka Stampy), who makes humorous Minecraft videos in his basement in the U.K. and has amassed more than 8.4 million global followers.\nBut that isn\u2019t typically how content targeting is approached when humans take the wheel. It\u2019s driven by broad category-level approaches and the gut instinct of the buyer rather than real-time consumer insight. Still, every advertiser has a right not to run next to ISIS videos. But most things aren\u2019t ISIS. They\u2019re Bill O\u2019Reilly, Kendall Jenner and PewDiePie -- safe territory that has suddenly become toxic -- and manual targeting approaches will leave you chasing your tail here, too.\nLuckily, with the right tools, the massive and growing volume of conversation data across social platforms and websites can be mined via natural language processing (NLP) to tell advertisers exactly what content consumers do care about in the moment, repeatedly and at massive scale. Speaking of Kendall Jenner and Bill O'Reilly, the same NLP technology would have automatically flagged these topics as controversial (based on sentiment detection) and instructed automated buying systems to avoid them as soon as the controversies erupted. The right tech can actually turn the challenge of consumer fragmentation into an opportunity, by leveraging the growing volume of social conversation to map consumer interests and align targeting accordingly.\nIn fact, we recently developed a product offering that connects NLP directly to real-time media buying decisions. We've seen this capability become increasingly valuable as audience attention continues to become more dynamic and unpredictable. For example, a men's magazine recently did an exclusive interview with Brad Pitt that went viral with women 25-", "gold_completion": "49. Even though advertisers were not initially aligned with the content, the system used context and conversation patterns to understand the who, what, and why and shift media dollars in real time.\nAccurate real-time alignment with relevant topics can be an effective way to proactively address both quality and safety concerns without locking down scale and flexibility. After all, do we believe that soccer moms were consuming ISIS videos, or were those consumer-packaged-goods ads just poorly targeted in the first place? If soccer moms were talking about these videos, it\u2019s highly likely that the sentiment wouldn\u2019t be positive.\nThat said, automatic blacklisting of problematic keywords and categories (e.g., terrorism) is a sensible safety layer that's worthy of investment. But completely reverting back to manual buying techniques does more than hurt scale and efficiency. It runs counter to the realities of consumer content consumption and will eventually leave marketers unable to achieve prime-time level scale and engagement online.", "no_wm_completion": "49 and women ages 18-29, but only generated $700,000 for print revenue.

Yet the decision-making systems driving online and mobile advertising have never been able to tell the whole story at scale.\nTaykey\u2019s platform solves this issue by combining sophisticated algorithms and social behavior patterns with human editors to deliver the precise targeting campaigns and insights that advertisers need. Our technology enables publishers to scale quickly with a very low total cost of ownership. For example, we're working closely with global publishers in the U.S. and Canada to help them deliver targeted, relevant audiences, especially in highly competitive industries such as insurance, technology, health care and finance.

The premiums collected are invested in two funds \u2014 pension equity plus and pension income fund \u2014 in certain proportion, as prescribed by HDFC Life. Here, the limitation is that the policyholder has no right to choose the fund option. The proportion of allocation is based on the policy term chosen. For instance, for the 35-year term, the allocation to equity fund in the first year is 80 per cent and 77 per cent in the second year. In the 20th and 30th years, the allocation to equity fund will be 29 and 2 per cent respectively. The allocation towards income fund increases as you near the maturity date.\nHDFC Life Click 2 Retire is cheaper than other pension ULIPs available in the market. The premium allocation and policy administration charges are nil. The fund management charge is 1.35 per cent of the fund value. The average expense ratio of the direct and regular plans of the balanced mutual funds were at 1.2 and 2.3 per cent (as of February 2018). About 0.5 per cent per annum is levied (on fund value) as investment guarantee charge across the policy term. This is higher relative to some other pension ULIPs that levy the charge only on the sum at risk. That means they charge nothing if fund value exceeds the total premium paid.\nOn death, the higher of the fund value or the 105 per cent of the total premiums paid so far is given. The nominee can either withdraw this amount as lumpsum or purchase an annuity product from HDFC Life to get pension. On maturity, the policyholder is given higher of the fund value or assured vesting benefit.

Lynton Crosby\u2019s last text to me predicted that we were going to \u2018do well\u2019, which according to our expectations would mean a Conservative majority of more than 60. A late projection, based on data from the ground and Jim Messina\u2019s modelling, suggested we would win 371 seats, giving us a majority of 92. In the end, the Conservatives got their highest share of the vote since 1983, and more votes than Tony Blair managed in any of his elections, yet still we ended up with a hung parliament.\nSkilful leadership may deliver stability, but the absence of an overall majority means the nature of the Brexit deal the government negotiates is more uncertain. There has long been talk of a choice between \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 forms of Brexit, with the latter requiring membership of the EU\u2019s single market. Since that would involve accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, vast annual membership payments to the EU, and the continuation of free movement rules, people who voted to leave the European Union might wonder whether advocates of a \u2018soft\u2019 departure really do understand that Brexit means Brexit.\nBecause this election failed to produce the majority we needed, it is impossible to call the campaign anything but a failure. Before it began, we envisaged a return to traditional campaigning methods, with daily press conferences to scrutinise Labour and promote our policies. Theresa, never comfortable hogging the limelight, expected to make more use of her ministerial team. On the advice of the campaign consultants, and following opinion research that showed Theresa to be far more popular than the party or her colleagues, we eschewed our instincts. We were wrong to do so.\nMy biggest regret, however, is that we did not campaign in accordance with the insight that took Theresa to Downing Street in the first place. While the referendum result was undoubtedly an instruction for Britain to leave the EU, it was also a vote for change. One can disagree with Theresa\u2019s prescription \u2014 a strategic role for the state to broaden economic opportunity, a clampdown on corporate excesses, rights for workers, intervention in dysfunctional markets and, through school reform, house-building and tax policy, a determination to make Britain the world\u2019s Great Meritocracy \u2014 but it is very difficult to disagree with her diagnosis.\nThat is why the Conservative manifesto, which I authored jointly with the brilliant Ben Gummer, rejected \u2018untrammelled free markets\u2019 and \u2018selfish individualism\u2019, and declared that \u2018our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals\u2019. I was surprised to read some commentators describe these statements as \u2018left-wing\u2019 when the manifesto was consciously Burkean in its style and substance. Burke\u2019s great revelation was that if we value something, we must be prepared to reform it in order to keep it. I fear the election will cause many to conclude that we should return to the modern consensus politics of pure social and economic liberalism, which I believe is one of the causes of the division we see in Britain today.\nThe manifesto was later written off as \u2018the worst in history\u2019. One of the criticisms is that, instead of offering voters giveaways and bribes, we spelt out where cuts would fall.

Somehow we have reached a point where older people with assets expect younger, poorer people to pay for their care.

Smartphone apps and wearable sensors have the potential to encourage positive change.\nDALLAS \u2014 Smartphone applications and wearable sensors have the potential to help people make healthier lifestyle choices, but scientific evidence of mobile health technologies\u2019 effectiveness for reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke is limited, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, published in the association\u2019s journal Circulation.\nThe new statement reviewed the small body of published, peer-reviewed studies about the effectiveness of mobile health technologies (mHealth) for managing weight, increasing physical activity, quitting smoking and controlling high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.\n\u201cThe fact that mobile health technologies haven\u2019t been fully studied doesn\u2019t mean that they are not effective. Self-monitoring is one of the core strategies for changing cardiovascular health behaviors. If a mobile health technology, such as a smartphone app for self-monitoring diet, weight or physical activity, is helping you improve your behavior, then stick with it,\u201d said Lora E.

When considering an mHealth weight loss program, healthcare practitioners should look for one that has many of the same elements as successful person-to-person individualized programs administered by healthcare professionals, which emphasize a calorie-controlled diet, physical activity, self-monitoring or recording food intake and physical activity in a paper or digital diary, personalized feedback and social support.\nPhysical activity \u2014While the majority of studies show that using an online program boosted physical activity more than not using one, there hasn\u2019t been enough research to show whether wearable physical activity monitoring devices actually help you move more.\nSmoking cessation \u2014Mobile phone apps using text messaging to help quit smoking can almost double your chances of quitting, but about 90 percent of people using these apps fail to quit smoking after six months. Mobile health apps used in combination with a traditional quit-smoking program may help smokers kick the habit.\nCurrently, there is little or no U.S.-based mHealth technology research on diabetes, blood pressure or cholesterol management.\nStatement authors reviewed mHealth randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses from the last decade. Most mHealth technology studies were short-term and limited in size.\n\u201cNevertheless, don\u2019t dismiss the possibility that these devices and apps can help you be heart healthy,\u201d Burke said.\nTo choose a mobile health technology that works for you, ask your healthcare provider, fitness instructor, registered dietitian or similar expert, to help find an effective program, she added.\nThe statement also encouraged researchers to embrace the challenge of producing the needed evidence regarding how effective these new technologies are and how we can best adopt them into clinical practice to promote better patient health.\nCo-authors are Jun Ma, M.D, Ph.D.; Kristen Azar, R.N., M.S.N.; Gary Bennett, Ph.D.; Eric Peterson, M.D., M.P.H., Yaguang Zheng, Ph.", "gold_completion": "D., M.S.N., R.N.; William Riley, Ph.D.; Janna Stephens, Ph.D., R.N.; Svati Shah, M.D., M.H.S.; Brian Suffoletto, M.D., M.S.; Tanya Turan, M.D., Bonnie Spring, Ph.D., Julia Steinberger, M.D., M.S. and Charlene Quinn, Ph.D., R.N.

{"prefix": "Richards Bay is joining other coastal cities and building a desalination plant to survive the crippling drought. By converting sea water into fresh, the plant will allow the town to tap into what engineers refer to as an \u201calmost infinite\u201d water resource.\nBut water and sanitation officials say the option is one of \u201clast resort\u201d and has come about because of slow work by the water department on other projects.\nThe water department\u2019s own plans show that desalination was seen as a last resort \u2013 becaue it is so expensive and uses so much electricity. Research by the Water Research Commission breaks this down: the City of Cape Town can produce water for R1.25 a kilolitre using a mix of water sources, while Rand Water in Gauteng can produce water for R2.50 per kilolitre.\nBut a large desalination plant along the coast produces water at anywhere between R5.80 and R8.30 per kilolitre.\nBig plants, such as the one being built in Lamberts Bay in the Western Cape, use huge amounts of electricity to remove salt from seawater so that it can be drunk safely. A conventional water treatment plant uses 0.3 kilowatt-hours of electricity to treat a cubic metre of water, while a desalination plant uses up to eight kilowatt-hours of electricity.\nIn its desalination strategy, the water department notes that while the process \u201ccould provide an unlimited resource of freshwater\u201d, it would only be considered after all other options. This is because of the escalating cost of electricity and the lack of a local desalination-plant industry and expertise.\nOther options would include, for instance, treating sewage water back to drinking water, a much cheaper process in terms of electricity and cost. An attempt to do this in Durban was rejected by the local community, which refused to drink the water on religious grounds. There is also the option of fixing old water infrastructure in municipalities, where up to a quarter of the water is lost through leaks.\nBut the decision to desalinate seems to be the result of delays to other infrastructure projects. An official at the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority says desalination \u201cwas always going to be the technology of choice, in the future\u201d. The statement is based on documents such as government\u2019s 2012 National Water Resource Strategy. This master plan looked at how much water each town and city needed, and how much the water department could supply up to 2035.\nFor most cities, water use was projected to outstrip supply before that date. In Johannesburg and Cape Town, that crunch would come before the end of this decade. For Durban and areas such as Richards Bay, people and industry were already using more water than was available by 2005.\nSolving that problem has been the job of the water department, through agencies such as the Tunnel Authority. Mega-projects, such as the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, fall under its purview. This critical scheme is half a decade behind schedule.\nAlthough there are 4 400 registered dams across South Africa, the country\u2019s water security relies on fewer than 50. Upgrades to these dams, such as that planned for the Tzaneen Dam in Limpopo, have been delayed by years or indefinitely postponed. Upgrades to Hazelmere Dam, which supplies Durban", "gold_completion": " and the North Coast, were delayed by six months last year. De Hoop Dam \u2013 opened by the president with much fanfare three years ago \u2013 has been similarly delayed by half a decade.\nThese infrastructure delays mean that when a drought hits, there is not enough water stored to get communities such as Richards Bay through the dry times. Mhlathuze Water, which supplies the area, implemented rolling restrictions last year. Similar restrictions in the 2009 drought saw emergency desalination plants built in Mossel Bay, Sedgefield and Plettenberg Bay. The Hillcrest aluminium smelter in Richards Bay opened its own plant last year, at a cost of R74-million.\nNevertheless, the expense is expected to be high, because the technology is still developing.

There is also the question of how the area is going to be developed. How will the plants be paid for \u2013 by who? The city plans to be independent and run by private investors. But will they be able to raise the money to pay for the plants and for the infrastructure that will link them to the main system?\nIt may be too little, too late for the South African coast.", "gen_completion": ", are in much worse condition.

There were no licenses for stand-alone fast-food restaurants, but chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in South Los Angeles from 2008 to 2012.\nAlmost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food, the study found.\nResearchers also compared obesity rates in South Los Angeles and other parts of the county using surveys that asked residents to report their weight and eating habits.\nBefore the fast-food ordinance, 63 percent of South Los Angeles residents reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 percent in other parts of the county. Three years after the ordinance went into effect, 75 percent of South Los Angeles residents reported being overweight or obese compared to 58 percent in other parts of the county.\nSupporters said the ordinance worked because it prevented chains from opening new restaurants at major intersections with their own drive-thru windows and parking lots.

{"prefix": "To get across Dublin city from, for example, St Vincent\u2019s University Hospital on the southside to Beaumont on the northside or to Connolly in the west could take 30 minutes at a quiet time of the day. At rush hour, it could take double that or even more.\nWith that in mind, nursing organisations are asking why would the Government be looking for a provision in a controversial new contract that would allow nurses working in Dublin to be moved between locations on opposite sides of the capital during a single shift, given the practical difficulties that may present.\nNursing unions and public service management will on Tuesday attend the Labour Court in a bid to resolve differences on a new contract which have complicated and could even threaten the proposed settlement to the recent nurses\u2019 strike.\nThe introduction of a new contract formed a key element of the original Labour Court recommendation that led to the suspension of the strike.\nNurses had been seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups such as physiotherapists who, they maintained, earn about \u20ac7,000 a year more.\nUnder the proposals, a new enhanced nurse grade would be introduced to which nurses could migrate after three years. Those moving on to the new grade would receive a salary increase of \u20ac2,439 or 7.3 per cent. The deal would also see significantly more nurses qualifying for additional allowances. However, there were also to be new cost-saving measures in a new contract to offset the cost of the proposed deal which could run to \u20ac50 million by the end of 2020.\nThe Irish Nurses\u2019 and Midwives\u2019 Organisation (INMO) initially urged members to back the Labour Court recommendation. However, when the Government\u2019s contract proposals were leaked, they caused consternation.\nThe Irish Times reported at the beginning of March that the Government wanted provisions to transfer nurses between locations \u2013 potentially within a 40km radius \u2013 for weeks at a time or even within a single shift.\nThe Government proposals could also see nurses rostered to work shifts lasting four, six, eight, 10 or 12 hours.\nThe INMO had seen the new contract as a potential opportunity to modernise nursing practices. However, it contended the Government proposals would actually worsen existing working arrangements.\nThe proposals were rejected by both the INMO and Siptu.\nWhile Government representatives agreed to some changes in the proposals during direct talks with unions and at the Workplace Relations Commission, they insisted on retaining provision for the roster reforms and to move nurses between locations.\nThis is the impasse that the Labour Court will seek to break this week.\nThe question as to why the Government has insisted on such controversial changes which potentially could jeopardise an overall agreement has been debated widely in industrial relations circles in recent weeks.\nSome believe the Government\u2019s target in its contract proposals is not actually the nurses but rather the wider public service trade union movement.\nFrom the start of the process, the Government was determined a settlement to the nurses\u2019 dispute would not cause a breakdown in the existing public service accord, leading to a pay free-for-all across the State sector.\nHowever, the other public service unions have so far held off on launching their much-anticipated knock-on claims. But they have not gone away. They are watching developments very carefully to see how any eventual nurse settlement plays out.\nSo what will the nurses have to give in productivity or work-practice changes in return for additional payments?\nSome senior industrial relations figures believe the Government is sending a message to the broader public service union movement that if", "gold_completion": " they seek more money outside the terms of the current accord, it will come at a price of work-practice reforms that they may find unpalatable.\nIn the meantime, the INMO is expected to argue that seeking nurses to relocate up to 40km is not feasible and would, in essence, discourage recruitment when the health service badly needs to attract more staff and hold on to those it already has.\nThe union is also understood to be greatly concerned at the proposed roster changes. At present, there are two main shift arrangements for nurses, a 7.8-hour day and a 13-hour day (of which they are paid for 12).\nIt is understood the INMO is worried that if new proposals were written into a contract, it could lead to staff having to attend hospitals or other workplaces more frequently \u2013 with implications for family or childcare arrangements in a predominately female workforce \u2013 or even to the introduction of split shifts where the working day is divided into two or more parts.", "no_wm_completion": " the government is not prepared to go for the full package in an overall trade-deal agreement, it will not be getting enough from the nurses.

Jeb Bush put an end to race-based admissions has shown, instead of a decrease in minority enrollment, an increase of 12 percent.\nMr. Bush, whose plan allows the admission of the top 20 percent of graduating seniors from each state high school, whether predominantly black, white or Hispanic, said the increase was proof that diversity in other college systems could be accomplished without affirmative action.\n''The most diverse in history,'' Mr. Bush said of the incoming freshmen, who are the first students to be admitted without affirmative action mandates since racial set-asides were put in place in Florida in 1978.\nHe said his plan, called One Florida, produced an incoming class of more than 40 percent minorities -- blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans -- and could be a model for other states whose affirmative action laws are being challenged in the courts or at the polls.\nBut critics of the plan say it is far too soon, after one year, to call the plan a success. Some experts on education reform called the new system a gimmick that simply gives affirmative action a new name.\nMr. Bush dismissed the criticism as he celebrated what he said was a clear victory in a difficult social and political arena. Black leaders here had said the plan would cripple college admissions of blacks.\n''I've spent the last 10 months getting blistered by people who didn't believe we could do this,'' Mr. Bush said.\nUnlike in Texas and California, which have similar programs that produced initial drops in minority enrollment, ''we did not wait for a legal challenge or a ballot initiative,'' said Mr. Bush.\nTexas courts threw out affirmative action laws in 1996, but the state eventually restored its racial mix on college campuses under a plan in Texas under Gov.

Black Umfolosi also works with many charities in Africa, Jensen said.\n\"If Mary and Joseph were showing up at some countries right now, certainly including the United States of America, they would definitely be turned back,\" added Jensen. \"The message is timely and it's delivered in a beautiful way.\"\n\"Reaction to the song and the video has been quite extraordinary so far,\" Gallant said.\n\"And with Black Umfolosi, they were so wonderful to work with \u2014 such gentle, beautiful people and were very much into it and so patient,\" he said.\nGallant predicts the song, available on iTunes and on streaming services, \"will make no money whatsoever probably, because basically on streaming services you're pretty much", "gold_completion": " giving it away.\"\n\"But I wanted people to hear it, and I'm hoping that it moves people to think about what's going on in the world.\"\nJensen said he believes the song is catchy and could become a holiday classic.\n\"I would not be at all surprised if it became, at least in Canada, a kind of Christmas standard that you start hearing every year.\"\nHe also said he hopes the African group becomes more widely-known from the song.\n\"If this single is out there on commercial radio, it's going to open those guys up to some new listeners,\" Jensen said.\nWant to hear the song in person?

In addition, Javelin senior analyst Nick Holland points out that \u201cconsumers have a short memory, [and are also] well-protected by their credit card companies\u201d in terms of limiting their liability for unauthorized purchases.\nHolland explains that even though we reacted with \"shock and horror\" following the massive Target (NYSE:TGT) data breach at the end of 2013, there is an upside: The incident forced the public and the government to finally address the vulnerabilities of our current system.\nHaving to sign a receipt for a purchase will eventually go the way of transistor radios and flip phones. You know those electronic signature pads at many checkouts? In Holland\u2019s words, signing one is \u201clike a drunk writing on an Etch-a-Sketch.\u201d Not only does it not remotely resemble your actual handwriting, it\u2019s barely legible. (When is the last time the clerk even bothered to compare it to the signature on the back of your credit card?) Using your fingerprint would be a lot safer. The folks at Apple have already anticipated this and have added a fingerprint scanner to new iPhones. Your voice might also be used to authenticate your purchase down the road.\nFive years from now, the study forecasts all types of electronic payments to increase as cash purchases fall to 17% and checks to 5%.\nFrom the consumer\u2019s perspective, consider the everyday example of putting gas in your car. If you\u2019re paying by cash, you fill your tank, walk into the store, stand in line to pay and wait for the cashier to make change. Compare this to driving up to the pump, swiping your credit card and immediately driving away after you fill up.\nThere\u2019s also the \u201cup-spend\u201d factor: If you\u2019re using plastic, your spending is not limited by the amount of cash in your wallet.\nHolland adds that electronic transactions are \u201can international leveler.\u201d If you have a credit card, travel outside the U.S. no longer requires you to bring a wad of foreign currency or travelers checks.

According to Holland, there has also been \u201ca broadening of electronic products\u201d beyond those that typically come to mind. For instance, he says branded pre-paid cards from MasterCard and Visa are bringing the advantages of electronic transactions \u201cto people who would typically not qualify for a checking account....These are really sophisticated products.\"\nLook at it this way: Your mobile phone already provides you with special offers, coupons and purchasing incentives that you don\u2019t get with cash or checks. These types of value-added services increase loyalty and sales- two things highly desired by retailers.\n1.

The credit card you\u2019re using probably charges a 0% interest on your purchases, and the rewards for using your credit card probably outweigh the costs of making purchases with cash.\nHolland thinks that consumers will eventually get on board with an electronic payment system that offers more options and choices. But this doesn\u2019t mean their attitudes toward plastic will shift overnight. In the meantime, the sooner that we get a card system into place in the U.S., the better off we\u2019ll be\u2026 because, hey, the cost of buying something on the web versus at the store won\u2019t matter as much.\nClick here to see the list of companies included in the Best Consumer Defensive Sector of 2012 for further analysis.\nRelated Links:\nStocks To Watch", "gen_completion": ";\nall from the safety of the convenience of digital payment and the convenience of having the money in an electronic account immediately.

As 60 photos showing the duke and his new wife meeting the Nazi leadership sell at auction for \u00a36,830, BBC News examines the story behind the pictures.\nThe unofficial royal visit to Germany caused much controversy and the former King Edward VIII has since faced numerous accusations of being a Nazi sympathiser.\nHowever, royal historian Carolyn Harris said his motives were \"peaceful\" and linked to the acceptance of his new wife, the American divorcee Wallis Simpson, for whom he had abdicated as king in 1936.\nShe said the duke was \"eager to carve out a new role for himself and ensure that his wife was treated as a full member of the Royal Family even though she had not received the title of Her Royal Highness - an issue that was of great concern to the duke\".\nShe added: \"There was no precedent for an abdicated sovereign assuming an active public role on behalf of the current sovereign and the Duke of Windsor was frustrated that he appeared to be expected to live a quiet life in exile.\"\nSo the duke jumped at the chance to go to Germany when invited by its government, even though the British government did not support his decision and would have preferred the couple keep a low profile.\nHis equerry Sir Dudley Forwood, who compiled the photo album, also said years later the unofficial trip was not a bid to support the Nazi regime, but instead to enable the duchess to experience a state visit.\nTimothy Medhurst, of Duke's Auctions in Dorchester, Dorset, said the images showed the couple \"in a relaxed environment being shown around by Nazis who are clearly proud of their nation\".\n\"It is a unique piece of history compiled at a time when the Nazi war machine was preparing for European conquest and the systematic slaughter of millions of people,\" he added.\nImage caption Royal historian Carolyn Harris said the duke's motives for visiting members of the Nazi regime were \"peaceful\"\nMs Harris, who specialises in European monarchy, said: \"The Duke of Windsor was familiar with Germany -

Ted Golos, professor of obstetrics and comparative biosciences, studies how other infections during pregnancy impact newborn health. The research group has extensive experience with viruses in humans and nonhuman primates \u2014 such as HIV and influenza \u2014 and their work will be conducted in secure facilities designed for the safe study of potentially harmful viruses.\nTheir work will start with basic questions about Zika virus infection. Very little is known about the virus even though more than 50 years have passed since it was discovered in the Zika Forest in Uganda.\nUntil recently, Zika was expected to cause little more than flu-like symptoms \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists fever, joint pain and a headache \u2014 in about 20 percent of the people it infected.\nThe rapid spread of the virus and potential connection to an otherwise rare birth defect have drawn plenty of attention from the public and from government officials.\nIn January, the National Institutes of Health made Zika virus research a high priority, and the groundwork underway at UW\u2013Madison led to NIH support for a series of studies of the virus in macaques, monkeys whose physiology and immune systems are similar to humans.\nThe researchers will track the effects of initial infections, but also try to establish whether one Zika virus infection provides some protection against future infection \u2014 like chicken pox does.\nZika does not mutate particularly fast, the feature of HIV and influenza that makes those viruses hard to pin down with vaccines (like HIV) and leaves people open to reinfection seasonally (like flu). This may make Zika easier to head off with a vaccine, but the best sort of immune response to provoke with a vaccine is not yet", "gold_completion": " known.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to have data that shows what natural immunity looks like and the sort of immune responses that arise to protect an individual when they encounter that virus again,\u201d O\u2019Connor says.\nPerhaps more hotly anticipated will be results from planned studies of Zika and pregnancy.\nOr whether the timing of the infection during pregnancy matters. Or whether it is direct infection of a developing fetus by the virus or the immune response the infection sparks in pregnant women that causes problems like microcephaly.\nWorking with the Zika virus from the original 1947 discovery in Africa and from the ongoing South American outbreak \u2014 provided by UW\u2013Madison Osorio and Aliota, who were first to identify Zika virus circulating in Colombia in October \u2014 the researchers also hope to identify any important differences in infection by the different strains.\nO\u2019Connor also hopes results from the studies will help settle minds around the world, and help change the tenor of Zika news stories.", "no_wm_completion": " known.\nBecause primates are similar to humans, the scientists will be studying Zika virus in some other way than just an injection.

About 95 percent of the known cases of Zika infection are reported in Latin America \u2014 about 50,000 people per year \u2014 and about 50 percent of those people have mild signs \u2014 mostly an increase in red blood cells, according to the World Health Organization.\nStill, it is possible that other strains \u2014 if they show up in South America or the United States \u2014 have the potential to do more than just cause fevers.\n\u201cAll viruses are", "gen_completion": " a sure thing, experts note.

The university also aims on developing several Zika-specific vaccines; at times researchers in other groups have licensed work out elsewhere. If this approach eventually proves successful, these potential vaccines would never have to enter a human clinical situation, unless they provide a full response, which might include a chance to infect multiple children.

{"prefix": "1947: Capt. Charles E. \u201cChuck\u201d Yeager pilots the rocket-powered Bell X-1 to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. In breaking the sound barrier, Yeager becomes the fastest man alive \u2014 and the legend of the X-Planes begins.\nAs airplanes flew faster and faster throughout the 1930s, pilots began to experience a number of problems associated with the increased airspeed. Aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 and Republic P-47 flew just fine at ordinary speeds in level flight. But if pilots put them in a high-speed dive, they began to experience control problems that led to the deaths of several pilots.\nThe main problem facing these pilots was the aerodynamic condition known as compressibility. Simply stated, at speeds well below the speed of sound, most of the air molecules have time to get out of the way of an aircraft as it approaches, and the density of the air does not change.\nHowever, as the speed of sound is approached, the air molecules can\u2019t get out of the way, and more of them hit the aircraft. The impact compresses the air in front of the aircraft and increases the air density. Eventually shock waves form around the airplane, affecting the lift and drag. These changes were not well-understood and led to the loss of control in several aircraft.\nBecause the effects of compressibility are directly related to the speed of sound, a ratio is used to describe the speed of an aircraft. The Mach number is the speed at which an object is traveling relative to the speed of sound at a particular temperature. The name is in honor of physicist Ernest Mach, who studied high-speed gas dynamics.\nThe Bell X-1 was developed to research aerodynamics in the transonic region, or speeds just below and just above the speed of sound. After numerous flights with civilian test pilots, Capt. Yeager of the newly formed U.S. Air Force made his first powered flight in the X-1 on Aug. 29, 1947, high over the Mojave Desert of southern California.\nThe problem Yeager was experiencing was the ineffectiveness of the X-1\u2019s pitch controls, as shock waves essentially created an aerodynamic shadow around the tail. Changes were made to the horizontal tail controls, allowing Yeager to control the airplane's ability to pitch up and down, and flights continued. This knowledge would lead to the all-flying tail, or stabilator, standard on all supersonic fighters today.\nYeager was nursing two broken ribs on the morning of Oct. 14, after being thrown from his horse on a ride the night before. He boarded the B-29 bomber that was to carry the Bell X-1 to altitude. The plan was to fly to Mach 0.97. But Yeager says the new moving tail boosted his morale, and he wanted to fly faster.\nAfter climbing down into the X-1, which was carried like a bomb in the belly of the B-29, Yeager\u2019s friend and fellow test pilot Jack Ridley handed him a short, sawed-off section of broomstick. Yeager would use it to close the canopy of the X-1, because his broken ribs prevented him from closing the latch normally.\nPeople on the ground heard what sounded like distant thunder. It was the first sonic boom ever created by an aircraft. At age 24, Yeager had flown faster than the speed of sound.\nThe flight was kept secret, and the world wouldn\u2019t know about the first supersonic", "gold_completion": " flight until months later. The X-1 would fly more than a hundred more times, reaching a speed of Mach 1.45.\nSubsequent X-1 models would fly more than twice the speed of sound. Later X-Planes would fly even faster, reaching hypersonic speeds where the density of the air wasn\u2019t the only thing to change: They would fly so fast, the chemistry of the air would change.\nCapt. Yeager would go on to become Gen. Yeager and the iconic test pilot. He was the first commandant of the Air Force\u2019s test-pilot school and continued commanding fighter squadrons into the 1960s.\nNow age 86, Yeager will return this Saturday to the skies over the Mojave desert.

It happened at low altitude; the X-1 was only about 35,000 feet when Yeager made his flight.

The X-1 is now one of the first aircraft to be designed in the post-World War II era out of materials that could not be tested on the military\u2019s test strip.\nLater in 1952, President Harry Truman designated the X-1 to be \u201cthe last manned test aircraft.\u201d It was used for several more years as a backup for military flights. On Sept. 23, 1961, it was retired as a test piece and flown to the Mojave, where Yeager donated it to California State University, Berkeley.

{"prefix": "Swiss power gear company ABB (s abb) has made another investment in tech that can make data centers more energy-efficient. Thursday morning, ABB says it has acquired controlling interest \u2014 through its venture arm (ABB Technology Ventures) \u2014 in Validus DC Systems, an 11-year-old company that makes power systems for data centers that utilize direct current (DC), which can make data centers more energy-efficient.\nI\u2019m hearing the deal is a large \u2014 eight-figure \u2014 buyout of existing shareholders, which included Oak Hill Ventures and Validus management, and a new $8 million Series B investment. The investment could also essentially be a two-step M&A, where ABB would have first dibs to buy the company outright at a later date. Validus previously raised at least $10 million from Oak Hill Ventures.\nValidus DC Systems sells data center power supply systems, along with converters and data center gear, based on DC tech. DC technology is more energy-efficient than AC (there is less energy lost in the transmission) and is also less complex and the gear can be built into smaller spaces. Validus says its DC technology can cut down on the total cost of a data center \u2014 via both energy savings and space savings \u2014 by 30 percent.\nIn addition to energy efficiency, use of DC technology can make a data center more reliable because there are fewer times in the system when the power has to be converted from AC to DC. DC can also pull in solar and wind power directly, though few data center operators are yet utilizing all that much clean power.\nABB already sells data center power gear like power distribution and management systems, emergency back-up power tech, circuit breakers, surge protectors, motors and building control and automation systems. ABB also provides high-voltage DC lines for long distance power transmission and has supplied one of the longest HVDC lines in the world. Adding Validus\u2019 DC products into ABB\u2019s mix is a natural fit.\nABB has also been focused on energy efficiency of data centers in particular.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), data centers account for over two percent of energy consumption in the U.S., and that number is set to grow as more and more people buy up always-on gadgets and constantly connected computers.\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why, if DC technology is so much more energy-efficient than straight AC, don\u2019t most data center operators use this. Basically, the data center world is slow-moving and cautious, and has been using traditional tech for decades.

ABB has also taken a more proactive role developing new technologies like energy-efficient refrigeration to take advantage of the lower operating costs.\n\"The energy-efficiency revolution is far from over, and this acquisition is an exciting new step in helping to accelerate data center efficiency by more than 70 percent in key markets,\u201d Spiesshofer said in a statement. \u201cABB\u2019s extensive customer base and leadership position in the energy management field make us a natural choice to take Validus to the next level to become the most comprehensive energy management product provider in the data center market.\u201d\nValidus DC Systems co-founders Jodi Saylor, left, and Michael", "gen_completion": " a patented power management system.

{"prefix": "Recent reforms were hailed as progress, but advocates say the system is still riddled with problems.\nRecent federal reforms aimed at protecting prisoners from exorbitant phone bills still fall short of reining in prices on the the vast majority of inmate calls, federal officials and prisoners' advocates said Wednesday.\nThe new rules, enacted in February by the Federal Communications Commission, cap prices for out-of-state calls. But most calls from prisoners are in-state communications, which remain unregulated.\nAdvocates say call fees have long been a problem for inmates and their families. Costly charges can leave prisoners with thousands of dollars in phone bills when they get out. In some cases, people have been forced to choose between phone calls and food. And children who lack regular contact with their incarcerated parents are more likely to miss school, become homeless, or suffer depression.\nThe FCC, led by interim Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn, took a step toward addressing that problem last year. The agency's ruling capped prices for interstate phone calls at 21 cents per minute for prepaid calls and 25 cents per minute for collect calls. Previous prices had exceeded $1 a minute in some cases.\nWhen the FCC put forth its original ruling in 2013, it expressed a desire to address in-state rates as well, seeking comment on possible proposals to do so. But the telephone companies that challenged the out-of-state caps have threatened opposition to in-state rules as well, and any FCC attempt to reform them would likely trigger a legal battle over the FCC's jurisdiction.\nBut with in-state calls still unregulated, some prisoners are paying much more for their local calls. In New Jersey, for instance, some in-state calls can run more than $8 for 15 minutes on the phone.\n\"The reforms thus far, though significant, have had very little impact because the majority of inmate calling is intrastate,\" said Darrell Baker, an Alabama utility official who has led that state's push to lower its call rates.\n\"The FCC's decision did a lot, but it certainly didn't help for large numbers of people,\" said Cheryl Leanza, an advocate with the United Church of Christ.\nFCC leaders, including Clyburn, Wheeler, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, said last year's reforms are a starting point, but agreed that in-state calls still need to be addressed.\n\"We recognize that more needs to be done,\" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in his opening remarks at a Wednesday panel at the agency's Washington headquarters.\nThe FCC, however, is asking states to take the lead on intrastate calling. Some states \u2014 including Alabama \u2014 have taken steps to protect prisoners from predatory rates.\nSimilar to the FCC's out-of-state rules, Alabama moved recently to cap in-state call fees at 25 cents per minute.\nBut with most states still inactive on the issue, some are calling for federal intervention.\n\"The FCC has both the duty and the authority to act under the statute if states do not,\" Clyburn said.\nOthers think the FCC's role should be limited advising state officials.\n\"Much of the heavy lifting is now left to the states,\" said Jesse Wiese, who works with the faith-based criminal-justice reform group Justice Fellowship. \"We don't think the commission should regulate intrastate calls.\" Wiese said the agency should focus on working with lawmakers and regulators around the country to enact reforms.\nBut inmate calling problems aren't limited to high intrastate prices.

The problem is that these systems can be overly sensitive, cutting off calls when they pick up background noise like a child or wind. \"When the call is dropped, the prisoner has to call back again, which leads to another call-hookup fee,\" said Paul Wright, who heads the Human Rights Defense Center.\nBaker added that dropped calls have been the No. 1 complaint among the prisoners with whom he's talked.\nCommissioners also mentioned other priorities in continuing to reform inmate calling services. Wheeler, Clyburn, and Rosenworcel all expressed a desire to make the interstate rate caps permanent. The current figures were set on an interim status as the agency collects more data to set permanent rates.\n\"The relief for family and friends has been tremendous,\" said Clyburn, citing the ruling's early success. \"Call volumes have increased as much as 30 percent.\"", "no_wm_completion": " a prison phone system that's antiquated, and not the fault of the prisoner paying the fees.\n\"We've worked on both,\" said former Georgia inmate Christopher Brown, who now works for a nonprofit that creates an online service to connect Georgia inmates to those in need.

{"prefix": "It\u2019s not that the human immune system doesn\u2019t recognize HIV. Indeed, an infection causes the body to unleash antibodies that attack the virus, and initially some HIV is destroyed.\nBut HIV is able to quickly defend itself by co-opting a part of the innate human immune system \u2014 the immune system people are born with, called the complement. The complement includes a vital mechanism that prevents immune system cells from attacking the body\u2019s own cells. HIV is able to incorporate a key protein in that self-protection mechanism, CD59, and by doing so makes itself appear to be one of the body\u2019s normal cells, not an infective agent.\nIn laboratories at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Andy Qigui Yu, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, is testing a promising compound that may counteract HIV\u2019s ability to hijack the immune system\u2019s protection mechanism.\n\u201cHIV is very clever. As it replicates inside cells, it takes on the CD59. The virus is covered with CD59, so the immune system treats the virus like your own normal cells,\u201d Dr. Yu said.\nIn November, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced it had awarded nine new Grand Challenges Explorations Phase II grants, one of them to Dr. Yu. The Phase II grants were awarded to researchers who had received initial $100,000 awards and had shown promising results.\nThe new grant will support not only Dr. Yu\u2019s research into compounds that may block the ability of HIV to hide behind the CD59 \u201ccloak,\u201d but also his work to identify the mechanism the virus uses to incorporate CD59.\n\u201cIf we find that mechanism, then we can develop something to block that incorporation, and HIV may lose that protection from the immune system,\u201d Dr. Yu said.\nResearchers have been able in the past to generate antibodies that successfully attacked HIV in the laboratory. But these antibodies have failed in human testing because the virus in the body escapes from immune system attacks, Dr. Yu said.\nIn an attempt to disrupt HIV\u2019s hijacking of CD59, Yu and colleagues at IU and Harvard University crafted a molecule from a bacterial toxin that is known to bind to the CD59 protein. In laboratory tests, they administered the", "gold_completion": " molecule to blood samples taken from patients with HIV. The bacteria toxin molecule latched on to the CD59 proteins, revealing the viral particles to be invaders and enabling the antibodies to attack the virus.\nReporting their findings in the Journal of Immunology in December 2010, the researchers suggested that the molecule could potentially be developed into a new therapy to fight HIV/AIDS.\nMore recent experiments have indicated that the administration of the molecule enabled the antibody-complement to attack infected cells and not just the virus particles found in the blood samples. The next steps will include more extensive testing of the molecule in a broader range of patient samples, Dr. Yu said.\nGrand Challenges Explorations is a $100 million initiative funded by the Gates Foundation to help researchers worldwide explore innovative ideas in how to solve persistent global health and development challenges.

{"prefix": "Now, a new study offers insight into why some people shrug off physical touches and how families affected by autism may learn to share hugs without overwhelming an autistic child\u2019s senses.\nYale neuroscientists recruited 19 young adults and imaged their brain activity as a researcher lightly brushed them on the forearm with a soft watercolor paintbrush. In some cases, the brushing was quick, and in others slow: prior studies have shown that most people like slow brushing and perceive it as affectionate contact, while the faster version is felt as less pleasant and more tickle-like.\nNone of the participants in the current study had autism, but the researchers evaluated them for autistic traits \u2014 things like a preference for sameness, order and systems, rather than social interaction. They found that participants with the highest levels of autistic traits had a lower response in key social brain regions \u2014 the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) \u2014 to the slow brushing.\nAccording to Martha Kaiser, senior author of the study and associate director of the Child Neuroscience Laboratory at the Yale Child Study Center, the STS is a critical hub of the social brain. \u201cThis region is important for perceiving the people around us, for visual social stimuli and for perceiving social versus nonsocial sounds,\u201d she says.\nThe current findings suggest that the region is also involved in processing social touch and that its response is linked to the individual\u2019s social ability, she says.\nIf that\u2019s the case, finding ways to make social experience \u2014 including touch \u2014 more rewarding might be one way to help autistic people connect better with others.\nIndeed, Temple Grandin, the well-known author and animal scientist with autism, and the subject of a 2010 HBO biopic, famously built herself a", "gold_completion": " \u201chug machine\u201d to self-apply deep pressure to her body.

Making social touch more rewarding early in development might further help autistic children learn social skills, since learning is heavily dependent on pleasure.

Socialism has failed. What we have here is statism. And Hayek really opposed that. So how should we understand Hayek in the context of today\u2019s China?\u2019\u2019 asked Mr. Gao.\nIn August, the association held its ninth annual meeting, in Tianjin, to consider that.

{"prefix": "My best friend in college was a straight-A student, an English major. In part he got all A\u2019s because he is whip smart\u2014his essays were systematically better than everyone else\u2019s. But the other reason was that he refused to enroll in a course unless he was certain he would ace it. Consequently, he never really challenged himself to try something beyond his comfort zone. I, on the other hand, was not a straight-A student. My first semester I took atomic physics with Professor Delroy Baugh, self-proclaimed \u201cLaser Guy.\u201d I\u2019d never taken a physics course before in my life, and as a reward for my willingness to transcend my comfort zone I received a D.\nSomewhere between the two of us lies a sweet spot: if you only ever get 100 percent on your tests, they aren\u2019t hard enough. If you never get above 50 percent, you\u2019re probably in the wrong major. The trick is to be right enough, but not so right that you never allow yourself the opportunity to be wrong.\nSo, how wrong should you be?\nWilson and his colleagues derive the number from experiments in machine learning. Under loose assumptions, they show that the optimal error rate for training a broad class of deep learning algorithms is 15 percent. The fastest learning progress occurs when the error rate hits this sweet spot. They show that this number is also in line with previous work on learning in humans and animals.\nThe implications of the 85 percent rule in the classroom are straightforward. If you\u2019re a teacher, your tests should be difficult enough that the average score is 85 percent. If you\u2019re a student, the optimal level of challenge is about a B or a B+ average. An A might look nice on your transcript, but you could have stood to learn more from a class that was harder. Outside the classroom, the implications of the 85 percent rule are similar. If you are learning a new language, say on Duolingo, then you should be getting about 15 percent of the answers wrong. Otherwise, you\u2019re not being challenged at the right level to consistently improve in picking up your new language.\nBut the 85 percent rule only holds for one class of problems, where the point is to build up expertise over many trials. With other kinds of problems you really don\u2019t want to get them wrong at all. For example, should you believe in God? Pascal wagered that you should, because if you don\u2019t there\u2019ll be hell to pay. Most people make up their minds one way about this issue and tend not to change their position too frequently. This presents a paradox: suppose 50 percent of people believe in God and 50 percent don\u2019t. Half are on the side opposite the truth. Yet no matter what evidence you present them with they won\u2019t admit they\u2019re wrong. In this case we see an error rate of zero. Why is no one ever wrong about their belief in God?\nHere another answer comes from cognitive science, in a paper by Samuel Gershman of Harvard University titled \u201cHow to Never Be Wrong.\u201d In the paper Gershman considers the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. The idea is that any given theory comes with a set of undisclosed assumptions, which can protect the core theory from being disproved. For example, the seven-day creation story of Genesis is at odds with the fossil record. So if you accept the fossil record, do you have to forfeit Genesis?\nNope. All you have to do is note that a \u201cday\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be 24 hours\u2014especially not if God hasn\u2019t created", "gold_completion": " the sun and moon yet. The definition of day is merely an auxiliary hypothesis of the core theory that God created the world. Such auxiliary hypotheses form a \u201cprotective belt\u201d around the core theory, deflecting contrary evidence from pesky one-offs, such as a handful of really old rocks, while leaving the main argument unscathed.\nBut never being wrong isn\u2019t an especially good thing. To the contrary, being wrong is important because it is the first step on the way to being right. If you\u2019re never wrong, you never learn anything you didn\u2019t already know. So whether you\u2019re taking a test from the Laser Guy or reconsidering your slate of metaphysical tenets, getting a few answers wrong is like salting a meal: a little bit makes the whole thing better, just don\u2019t take it too far.\nCody Kommers worked in the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience lab at Harvard University. He lives in Boston.", "no_wm_completion": " a clock at all. Genesis 2:4 gives a clear answer: God created day and night. But if you want to keep your belief in the creation story, you can choose whether you accept the creation account or reject it.\nThe only time when we have to make an auxiliary assumption is in our perception of reality. When we start with a belief and then try to look for evidence, we are bound to make an auxiliary assumption if and when we encounter evidence against it. Once we have this knowledge we can then choose if to accept the evidence or to reject it. We can never have an incorrect belief about the presence of God because we already have a false belief in his existence.\nThe 85 percent rule also holds in an extreme case. Suppose God is real. Imagine God is so real that he is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. According to the 85 percent rule, if the theory you believe in is at odds with this evidence God exists then there is", "gen_completion": " a day in seven other places. Gassman follows the reasoning from his 80 percent teaching rule, which suggests that we sometimes end up using the core assumption when our best model is shown not be as good, or we need the additional information to come to an incorrect decision.

But you do need the additional information to come to an incorrect decision\u2014the original argument is still valid if only given a half chance to provide additional information.

Anticipating that lawyers representing the contractors will argue that they were acting in self defense, the prosecution is seeking to introduce evidence that \u201cseveral of the defendants had harbored a deep hostility toward Iraqi civilians which they demonstrated in words and deeds.\u201d The charges are similar to those that recently emerged in civil lawsuits against Blackwater, stemming from the Nisour Square episode.\nIn addition to verbal expressions of hatred towards Iraqi civilians, the defendants engaged in unprovoked and aggressive behavior toward unarmed Iraqi civilians in Baghdad. In so doing, the defendants routinely acted in disregard of the use of force policies that they were required to follow as a condition of their employment as Blackwater guards.\nThis evidence tends to establish that the defendants fired at innocent Iraqis not because they actually believed that they were in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and actually believed that they had no alternative to the use of deadly force, but rather that they fired at innocent Iraqi civilians because of their hostility toward Iraqis and their grave indifference to the harm that their actions would cause.\nDuring the twelve months proceeding the events charged in the indictment, while assigned to the Raven 23 convoy operating at various locations in the Red Zone in Baghdad, Iraq, defendant Nicholas Slatten made statements that he wanted to kill as many Iraqis as he could as \u201cpayback for 9/11,\u201d and he repeatedly boasted about the number of Iraqis he had shot.\nintentionally deployed to Iraq certain men who shared his vision of Christian supremacy, knowing and wanting these men to take every available opportunity to murder Iraqis.

{"prefix": "Most everyone who's been actively following Lone Ranger's progress has surely tired of hearing about the film's budget woes in the aftermath of Disney's highly-publicized efforts to cut down costs last year. Yet, the new blockbuster from Pirates of the Caribbean trifecta - namely, star Johnny Depp, director Gore Verbinski, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer - is having money problems yet again.\nInsiders (reliable ones, mind you) are reporting that Depp's unorthodox western has fallen days - possibly even weeks - behind schedule. More importantly, the budget is said to have risen above a \"lowered\" $215 million - and ballooned back up to the $250 million level that prompted Disney to halt the project's development in the first place.\nWith respect to principal photography being behind schedule: that's actually less of a concern, seeing how Disney recently pushed Lone Ranger's release date back from May 2013 to the fourth of July weekend slot previously occupied by Robopocalypse. Right now, newly-appointed Disney studio head Alan Horn is thought to be focused on trimming the film's budget (via script rewrites of certain expensive action scenes). Obviously, the Mouse House is all the more concerned about expenditures, after having to take an estimated $200 million loss on John Carter - which \"helped\" to force out Horn's predecessor, Rich Ross.\nObviously, the primary concern for moviegoers is whether or not Lone Ranger will ultimately prove to be worth all the behind-the-scenes financial drama.

That may not abate the concerns of fans who worry that the Ranger (Armie Hammer) could end up being a semi-comical footnote in his own movie, but encouraging word-of-mouth should be all the more welcome for Depp fans - especially given the mediocre reception for his most recent film, Dark Shadows.\nLone Ranger remains set to gallop into theaters around the U.S. on July 3rd, 2013.", "no_wm_completion": " contrast to Christopher Nolan's ROTJ-esque, red-band trailer; we're looking at you, Disney).

Another was a $2,180 shotgun, gifted to UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell by King in 2015 for his birthday.

That amount rose to $4.5 million in stolen funds, according to a plea deal for a third official charged in the conspiracy.\nThe case has led to criminal charges against three others: former Fiat Chrysler executive Alphons Iacobelli, former FCA financial analyst Jerome Durden and Monica Morgan, the wife of Jewell's predecessor, General Holiefield.\nThe head of the Detroit FBI, David Gelios, said \"years of fraud and corruption within a select group of the FCA and UAW hierarchy continue to be eroded through the diligence and collaboration of law enforcement.\"\nFCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said last month the \"deplorable\" conduct \"had nothing whatsoever to do with the collective bargaining process.\" The company also said in July that the \"egregious acts were neither known to nor sanctioned by (Fiat Chrysler),\" and declined to elaborate on Friday.\nThe document released Friday outlines how credit cards tied to the training center funds were distributed to UAW executives. In December 2012, Holiefield allegedly told King that Iacobelli did not have a problem with them using their NTC credit cards to purchase personal items \"if we see something we want.\"\nIn February 2012, Durden directed that payments to credit cards were to be \"screened\" from the members of the NTC accounting staff, and changed the security settings of the center's accounting software to further conceal payments", "gold_completion": ", according to the document.\nIacobelli and Holiefield's widow had not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.

But unlike at other conferences, where the flashing lights and neon colors that educators have come to expect emanate brightly from the stage, the mood was somber\u2014with keynote speaker Paul Saffo asking serious questions about the future of education and the role technology will play.\nAs attendees and exhibitors sat in their seats, sipping Seattle\u2019s trademark beverage, their eyes focused on the stage: Seattle\u2019s black skyline with hues of purple and blue, clouds massed on the horizon\u2014signaling rain clouds on the way.\nAccording to Saffo, there are some tips educators can use to predict the next big technological innovation that will directly affect the economy.\nFirst, take a look at history: In the 1950s, the key technological innovation was the television\u2014and the media expression of it was broadcasting in the 1960s. In the 1980s, it was the client server that led to the media expression of the World Wide Web of the 1990s. Earlier this decade, peer-to-peer file sharing and online social networks emerged, and perhaps in the next decade, sites like Twitter will be the definitive media expression.\n\u201cIf you look at these trends, technology makes the medium possible, but the \u2026 medium is not ubiquitous until the next big innovation comes along,\u201d explained Saffo. There is a trend of a decade\u2019s difference between the technology and the medium\u2014and most media will not be fully integrated until the next new technology is able to leverage the decade-old medium.\nSaffo listed examples, such as an avatar site called Habitat in the 1980s. Even though it was the same concept as we see today in sites such as Second Life\u2014the avatar moved around a virtual world, buying things and being able to talk to people\u2014the right platform just wasn\u2019t there, and it failed.\nAccording to Saffo, it wasn\u2019t until gaming became popular and gaming software improved that people got into virtual worlds. Thanks to new gaming technology, Second Life is now a huge success.\nAnother example", "gold_completion": " is handheld electronic books.

Then, just when educators and tech enthusiasts give up hope and severely lower expectations, the technology is diffused into society.\nSaffo also provided analysis of some future trends educators should look for: the rise of \u201csuperstar\u201d educators, thanks to the ability to blog and post free classes online; the change from the information revolution to the personal media revolution; and the switch from a consumer economy to a creator economy.", "no_wm_completion": " was mobile phones, a feature that hasn\u2019t yet taken off as a medium, but which could prove vital to the future of education.

Yet the smartphone will likely not be the most popular educational device for another decade.\n\u201cThat trend of a couple of years will predict a different trend of which apps will emerge in the next decade to leverage smartphones for teaching.

As mobile devices evolve, other technologies will follow\u2014and perhaps this change in technology could be the catalyst for a major wave of innovation.\nBut there\u2019s a caveat.

{"prefix": "\u201cMiracles From Heaven\u201d begins with voice-over narration from Christy Beam (played by Jennifer Garner), a Fort Worth mom who explains that a miracle is defined as an unexpected, positive event that cannot be explained by science. Of course, in reality, that\u2019s only part of the definition. Any unexplained, welcome situation necessarily needs the person or people involved in the event itself to decide that it\u2019s a miracle.\nThis poses a problem for the cinematic retelling of a story that its author is convinced is miraculous. In fact, it\u2019s a problem facing almost all recent faith-based films; faith is an unseen force, and film must give audiences something to see. \u201cMiracles From Heaven,\u201d then, qualifies as a success: It delivers its miracle without strain.\nBased on the memoir by Beam, \u201cMiracles\u201d tells the story of young Anna Beam (Kylie Rogers, \u201cSpace Station 76\u201d), whose unexplained digestive disorder leads Christy to battle with a variety of doctors and misdiagnoses. Confidently told that the situation is merely lactose intolerance, or acid reflux, Christy remains unconvinced. Anna vomits everything she eats and is in near-constant pain.\nDesperate for an answer, the mother and daughter travel from Texas to Boston, with Christy begging her way into seeing Dr. Samuel Nurko (Eugenio Derbez, \u201cJack and Jill\u201d), a leading pediatric gastroenterologist. Once there, Anna is diagnosed with intestinal motility disorder, a paralysis of the G.I. tract, a degenerative condition with no cure.\nDriven away from church by fellow members who blame sin for the child\u2019s illness, Christy\u2019s doubts overwhelm her. \u201cI don\u2019t have faith in anything. I can\u2019t even pray,\u201d she tells husband Kevin (Martin Henderson, \u201cThe Ring\u201d). Anna, too, succumbs to hopelessness, in one of the more honest depictions of childhood depression in recent mainstream film. A good-hearted pastor (John Carroll Lynch, \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d) and waitress (Queen Latifah) intervene, but nothing can solve the medical or spiritual crisis.\nThen comes the miracle of the title, and it either happened that way or it did not.

She makes only occasional moves into fluffy-cloud-based religious kitsch, wisely focusing instead on human beings trapped between belief and despair.\nMeanwhile, the film\u2019s real power comes from Garner, whose solid, memorable work anchors everything around her. Her anxiety spills into every frame she occupies as she demands answers, worries about health insurance coverage, and refuses to smile or stifle her anger. She is real and tough, in ways her film work has seldom given her the chance to be.

{"prefix": "1 What Are the Aims & Objectives of HR Development?\nOne of the key roles of the human resources department is to keep the workforce safe, productive and engaged in the company\u2019s activities and interests. HR training objectives support this role by educating employees and managers on the relevant procedures. Training objectives focus on what the organization needs to achieve and how to help employees attain company goals. Depending on the type of business and specific challenges the company faces, there are a wide range of possible HR training objectives. However, some are important in almost every organization.\nEvery employer has a duty to provide a safe and healthy working environment. Every employee has a duty to protect himself and those around him. Health and safety is an area that is often included as part of the HR function in small and medium-sized companies. In large organizations, there may be a dedicated health and safety department. Managers need to be trained in risk assessments and the importance of undertaking them regularly and correctly, while implementing any necessary actions quickly. Neglecting this duty can lead to injury, illness, death and legal action against the company. All of these have significant financial costs that may put the company\u2019s future at risk. As all staff must be made aware of health and safety issues and company policies, this is a significant ongoing training objective for every company.\nCompanies avoid unlawful behaviors and potential lawsuits by ensuring all staff are aware of the basic legal requirements regarding equalities and have an understanding of the benefits of diversity. Equality training equips managers to work within the legal structure and avoid discrimination in recruitment and how they treat staff. A diverse workforce brings many advantages to a company including a range of skills and ideas. However, it is important that everyone is able to communicate effectively with a desire to work together. HR training in diversity can help staff make the most of their working relationships and develop new insights into how the business interacts with its customers and the wider community.\nBeing able to manage staff effectively is essential for every manager. This includes how to run recruitment campaigns and choose the right people; supervise them and maximize their performance; maintain good employee relations; and build teams.

Beer Week, real estate observers are marveling over the market changes that have seen the return of the first production breweries to the District since the Christian Heurich Brewing Co. shut down its Foggy Bottom brewing operations in 1956.\nBack when D.C. Beer Week first started in 2008, there were no production breweries in the District proper. Now there are three, and two more breweries are planning to open. The growing popularity of craft beer in the region dates back to 1992 when Capitol City Brewing Co. became the first \u201cbrewpub\u201d to open in the city since Prohibition. Since then, numerous brewpubs have opened throughout the region. The chief distinction between these establishments and breweries is that brewpubs primarily brew beer for sale on site in their restaurant and bar locations, and as such they generally occupy retail/restaurant spaces.\nProduction breweries, on the other hand, primarily produce beer sold off-site in local bars, restaurants and other outlets. As production facilities, they generally occupy industrial-quality space, with high ceilings and reinforced flooring to accommodate the brewing, bottling and distribution equipment.\nThese days, the trend appears to be favoring more of a hybrid approach with the newest breweries serving their wares on site as well as having the production capacity for distribution.\nDC Brau Brewing Co. became the first production brewery inside the District lines since the Heurichs closed up shop. Originally operating in a modest 6,600-square-foot space at 3178 Bladensburg Rd. NE, the operation has since doubled in size (as of 2012) and currently operates out of 13,150 square feet.\nNext to follow suit was Chocolate City Beer, opening at 2801 8th S.t NE in 2011.

Delhi has a sizable voter population that belongs to the two states.\nThe AAP leader said attacking Modi directly during the MCD polls campaign may backfire.\nIn the recent Assembly election in Punjab, AAP could win 20 of 117 seats, while drew a blank in 40-member Goa Assembly.\nDuring the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, AAP's strategy revolved around attacking Modi.

Cup of Excellence competitions have been held in Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Rwanda, Costa Rica and Colombia.\nOn the first day of the competition there is an extensive calibration. During the next two days, the international jury cups the coffees that have been approved and passed by the national jury. On the fourth day, the jury cups about 45 coffees which have passed the first round. Coffees scoring an 84 or above during this round are awarded the prestigious Cup of Excellence.\nThe top ten scoring coffees are ranked again to discover the first place winner of the competition. Winning Cup of Excellence coffees are then sold through an internet auction. The most recent auction was held on January 18th, for the winning farms of the 2010 Brazilian competition. I was thrilled to see two of my friends receive the top two awards. Cl\u00e1udio Carneiro Pinto's Grota S\u00e3o Pedro farm was awarded first place. His coffee sold for $25.05 per pound. Carlos Segio Sanglard's Serra do Bone took second place. His coffee fetched $12.10 per pound. Of the thirty-one winners, these were the only organic lots.\nIn November, I had the extremely desirable assignment of traveling to Machado, Brazil and serving as a member of the international jury. Over the course of a week, we slurped, scrutinized, evaluated, and ranked the top forty-seven selections from the 2010 Brazil coffee harvest. This was my 9th Cup of Excellence jury invitation and 6th appearance as a member of the Brazil panel. The coffees were phenomenally clean, sweet, aromatic and delicious!\n\"While I was a consultant outside of the roasting/retail business, I became involved with a United Nations project that was trying to develop higher quality coffees in order to sell at higher premiums. So when specialty coffee was really growing (1990's), and there were many success stories, farmers were not feeling the benefit of that at all. That's when I co-founded the Cup of Excellence, which was an international competition where we brought in roasters from Japan, Europe, The Americas and around the world to taste coffees. That suddenly really raised the price and also brought attention and identity to single farmers for the first time, so within two to three years, entire regions -- not only farmers, but regions -- were being discovered. Brazil had always been discounted as being poor producers of quality. Suddenly they became desirable, their prices went up. Individual farms were able to make connections to roasters and roasters to farmers. So now you had Europeans, Japanese and Americans coming to Brazil to visit those farms and buy at higher premiums.\"\nI recently interviewed Cup of Excellence's other co-founder, Susie Spindler and asked her how she sees CoE as improving coffee quality. Here was her response.\n[\"The] Cup of Excellence program has improved quality by giving farmers a financial incentive to do the best job they can. The hope of winning a Cup of Excellence supports the focus on quality above all else at the individual farm. This means that hundreds of farmers every year try to improve their quality and even if", "gold_completion": " they do not win, this effort alone puts a lot more high quality coffees in the marketplace. The competition process also encourages farmers to educate themselves about the kinds of coffees the marketplace wants and with all of the cuppers and visitors now to the individual farms, higher overall quality is the end result. The program has completely busted the practice of blending everything so more coffees that are of higher quality have the opportunity to stand on their own and not enhance an otherwise poor quality blend.\"\nIf you're interested in learning more about Cup of Excellence, I recommend checking out their website. If you've never tasted a Cup of Excellence coffee, I'd enthusiastically encourage you to do so. A number of the Bay Area roasters are supporters of the program. Web searches will direct you to CoE roasters throughout the country. One word of caution, please make sure to check when the coffee was harvested and its roast date. The freshest in-season option will always be your best bet.", "no_wm_completion": " only a few go on to win, the overall perception of quality changes as a result. Farmers want to prove they are capable of being the best and to make their growers and roasters happy.\"\nWe love to see and read about how specialty coffee is growing in Africa. If you haven't already done so, read this report to learn more about the Africa Coffee Association and their incredible efforts to develop coffee growing in East Africa.\nIt was the second year for the event and my friend Carlos Segio Sanglard traveled to the country to represent Brazil. He said, \"I think it's a very important event because it allows people to see the difference that a few farmers can make to the entire economy. Just one coffee farmer with 10 acres can have a huge impact on the coffee economy of a rural community. It was especially important for me to represent Brazil because it has such a huge impact in the world. People in other countries hear about us and think, wow, coffee is everywhere.", "gen_completion": " only 10 percent are able increase their quality just one point -- win or loss or just one cup -- it\u2018s enormous.

The reason that the coffee quality in Latin America has become greater is thanks to Coffee Culture, of the World Cup and the Co-Exchange (a system by farmers linked to their Co-Exchange farms). Without these, farmers could easily have gone out last year when their quality would not be up for auction. Local co-existence at times seem the hardest way out but through coordination of both farmers who are linked to one other through coffee, through banks who are doing the financing, combined with a major marketing and promotion system introduced with a government program (BRAVE) by our government; coffee production is on track to double or triple over the", "z_wm": 21.39370346069336, "z_human": -6.278570175170898, "simcse": 0.78759765625}

{"prefix": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators on Friday adopted a new system of special fees paid by U.S. financial institutions that will shift more of the burden to bigger banks to help replenish the deposit insurance fund.\nThe move by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cut by about two-thirds the amount of special fees to be levied on banks and thrifts. It followed protests by small and community banks \u2014 with powerful allies in Congress \u2014 against a plan adopted in February that charged premiums based on the amount of deposits. The smaller institutions insisted they would be unfairly hit even though they didn\u2019t contribute to the financial crisis with reckless lending.\nThe FDIC board voted 4-1 to approve the new fee system. It is intended to raise $5.6 billion in the face of a cascade of bank failures that have depleted the insurance fund. The lone dissent came from U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan, whose agency regulates national banks.\nThe FDIC received more than 14,000 comment letters on the earlier fee plan. Typical of the anger was the letter from Dean Anderson, vice president of Lake Elmo Bank.\nThe American Bankers Association, the industry\u2019s biggest lobbying group, was happy to claim credit Friday for the FDIC\u2019s course change.\nBecause larger financial institutions tend to rely more on funding from sources other than deposits, bigger banks would end up paying a heftier portion of the new assessment. FDIC officials estimated that of the $5.6 billion the agency is seeking to raise, as much as $500 million that would have been paid by smaller banks under the previous plan now could be absorbed by larger ones.\nAlso, \u201cthere\u2019s a good probability\u201d that another emergency assessment would be needed by the fourth quarter, Bair said, though it wouldn\u2019t take effect without a public comment period.\nThe new FDIC emergency premium, to be collected from all federally insured institutions, will be 5 cents for every $100 of a bank\u2019s assets minus its so-called Tier 1, or regulatory capital, as of June 30. The FDIC\u2019s previous planned fee, intended to raise about $15 billion, was 20 cents per $100 of a bank\u2019s insured deposits. A measure of a bank\u2019s health, Tier 1 capital includes common and preferred stock as well as intangible assets such as tax losses that can be used to reduce future earnings.\nThe FDIC now expects bank failures will cost the bank insurance fund around $70", "gold_completion": " billion through 2013, up from a previous assessment of around $65 billion.

Bair earlier had promised a reduction in fees charged to banks if that credit line could be expanded.\nThe law requires the insurance fund to be maintained at a minimum level of 1.15 percent of total insured deposits.\nThe FDIC also recently levied a surcharge on banks issuing debt under the agency\u2019s temporary rescue program.\nUnder it, the FDIC guarantees hundreds of billions of dollars in debt in the event of payment defaults by the issuing banks. Those surcharges, nearly $8 billion collected already, will help compensate for the reduction in insurance premiums, the agency said.", "no_wm_completion": " billion.

In addition, regulators will keep a close eye on large banks with large reserves, a likely sign that more big bank failures are afoot. Those institutions\u2019 failure rates could worsen this quarter.\nDugan, the comptroller, said the measure could add another $50 billion to the fund. But he also noted that large financial institutions \u201chad every reason to expect more failures\u201d as large portions of that insurance fund have already been depleted due to mortgage debt.

The goal is for deposits to make it long without the fund lapsing altogether or needing to borrow to keep funding.

{"prefix": "A new study suggests that the death toll from drug overdoses in America is much more severe than initially believed.\nIn December, the CDC said 52,404 people had died from drug overdoses in 2015, with over 60% dying from opioids (prescription painkillers) and heroin. Overdose numbers have been rising for years, but new research published Monday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine suggests that those rates were dramatically underreported.\nOne reason for the gap? In many overdose cases, no specific drug is identified as the cause on the death certificate. Between 1999 and 2014, up to one in four drug overdose deaths had no single drug listed as the cause.\nThat doesn't mean researchers who want to correct the figures are out of luck, however. Even in cases in which no specific drug is listed as the single cause of death, officials often do list at least one category of drug present in the person's body based on screenings they do at the time. For the latest study, the researchers used that information to correct the data they had on drug overdoses.\nNationally, the \"corrected\" death rate (using the new paper's method) from opioid painkillers was 24% greater than reported rates in 2014; the rate for heroin was 22% higher.\nIn the states where gaps between reported and actual death rates were greatest \u2014 Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Louisiana \u2014 the percentages differed by up to 108%.\nThese results change the face of the US drug overdose epidemic substantially, as can be seen on the maps below. Reported overdose deaths for opioids and heroin are on the left; corrected deaths are on the right.\nThe corrected figures suggest that deaths from opioids were much more concentrated in the Mountain states, Rust Belt, and Industrial North \u2014 extending to New England \u2014 as well as much of the South.

A vote on the proposed cuts, which include cross country, golf, tennis, wrestling, lacrosse and slow-pitch softball, will be June 13.\n\"Part of that is it's a little too early to tell what the impact is going to be ... are they going to be able to put some of those back through the help of some outside organizations, it's a little too early,\" he said. \"We've been the fastest growing school district in the state the past four years (percentage-wise). Rapid growth and an influx of students is something we're used to. That's not going to change.\"\nSt. Johns County schools have increased their enrollment by an average of 922 students annually between 2007-2010, and that number could rise again if the scenario plays out in Duval County as it was presented this week. On Wednesday, Fox recommended to the school board that cutting 10 varsity sports would save $445,298.\nThat could send students scrambling for private schools or into surrounding counties to continue their careers. In addition to the high school sports, junior varsity soccer and two undetermined middle school sports will also be purged. According to the Florida Times-Union, the high school cuts alone would eliminate sports that 2,054 athletes competed in during the 2010-11 year.\nFlorida High School Athletic Association executive director Roger Dearing said that if the situation in Duval County plays out as is being projected, students couldn't just pick up and leave a program because of a sport not being offered there anymore.\n\"We would not ease the transfer rules,\" said Dearing, referring to Article 9 in the FHSAA bylaws about which covers student eligibility.\n\"They can't put on their application that they want", "gold_completion": " to go to school in St. Johns County to play lacrosse.

He is a smart, gentle spirit with a kind heart. I would be eager to hire him at Church Health, but it is not that easy.\nHe grew up in Aleppo, Syria, where he fell in love with wanting to help people through medicine.\nIn 2011, he had completed four years of his six-year medical training program (that is the way it is done in British-influenced countries) when things began to fall apart in Syria. Inspired by the pro-democracy movement, a group of school boys in Syria began writing anti-government slogans on walls.\nThe government reacted by rounding up the boys and torturing them. Protests broke out. The Syrian civil war had begun.\nThrough the early days of the war, Rami kept going to school. Then one day, for who knows what reason, he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in a dark basement. His family had no idea what had happened to him or where he was. He was just gone.\nHis cell was too small to lie down. He was fed once a day. He could hear other prisoners being tortured. After three months, he had lost 60 pounds. He was then asked, \u201cAre you sorry for what you did?\u201d He hadn\u2019t done anything, but he said, \u201cI am sorry.\u201d And just like that he was let go.\nHis parents knew they had to leave Syria. They escaped through Lebanon and came to where they had family in Memphis.\nRami arrived in Memphis in 2012. He did not speak a word of English, so he took ESL classes at the University of Memphis and spent a year learning English. His desire to be a doctor had not waned.\nBecause Rami had never graduated from college in a U.S. system, attending an American medical school was not an option. So he applied to a school in the Caribbean. He effectively had to start over, but he was determined, and he did very well.\nI met him through his cousin who cooks wonderful Syrian food at the Global Caf\u00e9 at Crosstown Concourse. I was shocked when I learned that this truly remarkable young doctor was stymied in moving on in his training to become a resident physician because of his circuitous path through medical school. His credentials do not match up the \u201cproper way,\u201d so training programs, including the one based at Church Health, are prohibited from offering him a position.\nIn Rami\u2019s case, I cannot even blame the bank.

A small hospital in the middle of Mississippi has found a way around the paperwork obstacles. If I am right, come March 15, there will be a way forward for Rami and his dream to become a physician. Until it actually happens, I will offer a prayer for him every day.\nThe issue is not just Rami.

{"prefix": "DANANG, Vietnam \u2014 Alex Huff is hard to miss among the dozens of children in the cafeteria at Phan Thanh elementary school. Blond-haired, blue-eyed and towering over his classmates, his legs are so long that his knees nearly touch his chest as he sits at a plastic table slurping up beef-noodle soup and milk.\nIn a city that was home to one of the largest U.S. air bases of the Vietnam War, in a school where the portrait of the late communist leader Ho Chi Minh hangs on the wall, 11-year-old Alex is a symbol of how even the deepest wounds can heal. But it goes further than that.\nHis Vietnamese is so good that he has astonished the country by placing second in a national storytelling competition that is as prestigious here as the National Spelling Bee in the United States. He is believed to be the first foreigner to do it.\nSince kindergarten, Alex has been the lone Westerner surrounded by a sea of Vietnamese children. His parents, Bob and Kathleen Huff, moved here more than five years ago from DeQueen, Ark., to work with disabled children. With no international school in the area, they enrolled their son in a kindergarten where no English was spoken. He later spent two years in a school in Hanoi before the family moved back to Danang.\nAt first, it was hard. The other children, who had rarely seen a Westerner, liked to stare as he labored over his lessons, or to rush up and touch his skin. Then he discovered that in Vietnam, too, they play tag and hide-and-seek, and he started to make friends.\nBut Vietnamese is devilishly hard to master. Although its alphabet is Romanized, it has six distinct tones, each of which can change the meaning of a word. The tones are what give the language its singsong musicality.\nAmericans started arriving in Vietnam in the 1990s as the country sought, like China, to open up to market forces without abandoning communist one-party rule. Some, like the Huffs, came to work with children. Others came to do business.\nAfter signing a pact normalizing trade relations in 2001, the United States and Vietnam last year had record two-way trade totaling about $2 billion. Companies like Nike have turned \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d into a fixture in American malls, and Vietnam ships a lot of seafood to the U.S. market.\nToday, an estimated 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam, mostly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, which both offer international schools. Danang in central Vietnam, 470 miles south of Hanoi, doesn\u2019t have that option. So Alex\u2019s three-story school next to an old Buddhist temple is an open-air affair with no air conditioning to keep the heat and humidity at bay.\nDanang was a base from which American warplanes took off for combat during the Vietnam War. Viet Cong guerrillas regularly rocketed the Marines\u2019 helicopter base a few miles to the south.\nNow the streets that once teemed with U.S. soldiers offer everything from Internet cafes to tour companies and clothing shops. The city of 700,000 is a constant symphony of construction noise, swarms of beeping motorbikes and people chatting or eating on the sidewalks.\nOverlooking China Beach, once a favorite for GIs on leave, is the five-star Furama Resort hotel with marble floors and tiled swimming pools.\nYet Danang maintains a small-town charm.

The disc arrives as Lucero marks 20 years together.\nThe making of \u201cAmong the Ghosts\u201d brought changes to the band\u2019s working methodology. Lucero\u2019s last three LP were cut at Midtown\u2019s Ardent studio with British producer Ted Hutt (Gaslight Anthem, Old Crow Medicine Show) behind the board. This time, the band elected to move to Sam Phillips Recording Service and co-produce the album themselves with local Grammy-winning engineer Matt Ross-Spang.\n\u201cPhillips is actually two doors down from our practice space,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cWe\u2019d worked there before, with [legendary producer] Roland Janes back in the day. But this time, we wanted to take a different approach to how we made it as compared to the last few records, and do it in a little bit more of a laid-back Memphis environment with Matt, who\u2019s a Memphis kid.\nRather than work for several weeks straight, the band instead did a series of hit and run sessions between tours: 10 days to start, then three days here, another five days there.\nThe disc also marks the first project without sax man Jim Spake, who left after several years and records as part of an expanded Lucero lineup.\n\u201cLucero has always been the kind of band that adapts to whatever is available at the time,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cWhen the horns were there, it was a lot of fun, and we were after that Stax Records soulful direction.

In a phone interview with The New York Times hours after the loss, Reed blamed Jordan Spieth for them not playing together, U.S. captain Jim Furyk for twice leaving him on the bench and he made it sound as though he was stuck with Woods as a partner in Paris.\nThis is one time Reed held his tongue.\nAfter his eighth and final birdie in balmy weather at Albany Golf Club, he acknowledged nothing more than they had talked.\n\u201cWhatever I talk about with other players and other guys stays between the guys,\u201d Reed said.\nHe also said he hasn\u2019t spoken to Furyk, and Reed told the New York Post on Tuesday that he hasn\u2019t spoken to Spieth, but that Spieth has his number.\nBut there\u2019s a Presidents Cup in between, next December in Australia, and while the intensity is not the same, the team concept is intact.

He says his ankles were sore from wear and tear, an issue he says has been around for a few months. On the golf course, he didn\u2019t hit it close enough or make enough putts, leading to only his third round over par in his last 21 rounds.\nWoods made consecutive birdies to get back to even par, and then it came undone on the par-3 12th when his tee shot went left, just inside a hazard line but still in play. But the chip came out short, rolled down the bank and past his feet into the water. He took a penalty drop, got it on the green and missed the putt to take triple bogey.\nWhat happens this week is of little consequence.\nMost players, except for European Tour members who two weeks ago finished the Race to Dubai, haven\u2019t played in a month and won\u2019t play for another month when the new year starts in Hawaii.\nReed was an exception.

All of the women in the study were obese.\nIn addition, the women with sleep apnea were more likely to develop preeclampsia, a condition of high blood pressure during pregnancy, and to deliver their babies by cesarean section.\nPregnancy complications linked to obesity \u2014 such as high blood pressure and gestational diabetes \u2014 are better understood than sleep apnea, which is an understudied and under-diagnosed condition in pregnant women, the researchers said.\nThere is a need for better ways to screen and treat sleep apnea in pregnancy, said study researcher Dr. Judette Louis, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of South Florida.\nPeople with sleep apnea experience pauses in their breathing during sleep. With obstructive sleep apnea, the pauses are due to a blocked airway.

{"prefix": "It's a well-known fact that some of our favourite seafoods come with an unsavoury dose of heavy metals like mercury. But there's another group of chemicals that sometimes lace our tuna steaks, and the latest findings on them are anything but appetising. They're called persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and they do a bang-up job obstructing the human body's chemical defence system. That's according to an analysis published today in Science Advances, examining how ten POPs found in both tuna and human bodily fluids interact with a gatekeeper protein that shuttles unwanted toxins out of our cells. The findings suggest that ingesting even very small quantities of POPs can do bodily harm.\n\"These chemicals interfere with our chemical defence system's ability to operate, which can make us more vulnerable to drugs and other toxins,\" Amro Hamdoun, a biologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and lead author on the study, told Gizmodo.\nPOPs have been around for a long, long time. One of the most infamous, the pesticide DDT, was developed during World War II. DDT was banned in the 1970s, but other POPs, including flame retardants and non-stick coatings, are still widely used today. While these chemicals are damn useful in many applications, they're a toxicologist's nightmare. They degrade very slowly in the environment, they accumulate in biological tissues and they have been been linked to everything from impaired neural development to obesity.\nHamdoun's study sheds new light on POP toxicity by demonstrating, for the first time, exactly how these chemicals shut down a key cellular defence system. Normally, foreign molecules are kicked out of our cells by a special transporter known as P-glycoprotein (Pg-p). \"Pg-p is a bit like a bouncer,\" Hamdoun said. \"Initially, we thought that these chemicals sneak past the bouncer. But what we found is that they actually form very intimate interactions with Pg-p.\"\nLaboratory tests revealed that ten of the most widespread POPs all bind tightly to this protective protein, inhibiting its ability to do its job. Even at levels where POPs themselves pose no hazard, \"they're interfering with the very systems and pathways that have evolved to protect us,\" Amro said.\nLevels of POPs in the environment are on the decline. But the ocean is a big place, and industry leaves a long legacy. \"The bottom line is, there are still reservoirs of these in the ocean,\" Amro said. \"And we are still being exposed to them through the consumption of seafood.\"\nWhich types of seafood and which part of the ocean", "gold_completion": " are most contaminated is something Amro and his colleagues are still figuring out. But we know enough to start taking some common-sense precautions, including routinely testing seafood and tracking potentially contaminated stocks.\n\"Tuna are in the upper five per cent of highly contaminated fish,\" Amro said. \"The good news is, we can reduce exposure by monitoring where they come from. The bad news is, we don't do that yet.\"\nSeafood is typically a very healthy source of protein, and only a small fraction of it is likely to contain appreciable levels of flame retardants and pesticides. But food distributors and regulators owe it to consumers to figure out where that fraction comes from.\n\"These compounds persist in the environment for a long, long time,\" Hamdoun said. \"We still see fish that have levels as high as they were 30 to 40 years ago. We need to find those fish, find those food products, and reduce or eliminate them in the food supply.\"", "no_wm_completion": " are most prone to POPs? You'd be surprised by how much of the world is contaminated by toxic seafood. In 2017, a Swedish study found that as much as 85 per cent of fish caught in Sweden were contaminated with one or more POPs. A 2018 survey by the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found that as many as half of the fish caught in Scotland were contaminated with one or more of the ten most widespread POPs, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins.\nOn top of that, fish is sometimes sold at markets, where chemicals get mixed in with food, including seafood. And tuna, which doesn't swim near bodies of water, seems safe. But eating tuna steaks, that get caught around oil and oil spills? That just leaves you wondering where the fish went to the bathroom.\n\"It's important to emphasise that these chemicals are already in the environment,\" Amro said. \"I think", "gen_completion": " are most polluted?

He kicked off the 112th Congress on Monday with a request to new Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Fred Upton (R-Mich.) to investigate whether a well-known climate skeptic lied to Congress on his CV.\nThe skeptic in question is Pat Michaels, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.

In his letter to Upton on Monday, Waxman raises the question of whether Michaels \u201cmay have provided misleading information about the sources of his funding and his ties to industries opposed to regulation of emissions responsible for climate change\u201d when he testified before the committee in February 2009.\nIn his curriculum vitae (PDF) provided to the committee at that time, under the section \u201cFinancial Support (Over $10,000),\u201d Michaels listed $4.2 million in income, attributing just 3 percent of it to industry sources\u2014excluding several major industry sources that have been disclosed in the course of litigation, including New Hope Environmental Services, Intermountain Rural Electric Association (IREA), Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc., and the free-market think-tank the Heartland Institute.\nAsked about whether he is funded by the oil industry in an appearance on CNN last August, Michaels first responded, \u201cNot largely.\u201d He was then asked how much of his funding comes from oil interests, to which he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, 40 percent.\u201d That, as Waxman writes", "gold_completion": ", certainly doesn\u2019t match up with the CV he provided last year.

{"prefix": "Maria Butina, accused in the United States of spying for Russia, had wider high-level contacts in Washington than previously known, taking part in 2015 meetings between a visiting Russian official and two senior U.S. officials.\nThe meetings, disclosed by several people familiar with the sessions and a report prepared by a Washington think tank that arranged them, involved Stanley Fischer, then Federal Reserve vice chairman, and Nathan Sheets, then Treasury undersecretary for international affairs.\nButina traveled to the United States in April 2015 with Alexander Torshin, then the Russian Central Bank deputy governor, and they took part in separate meetings with Fischer and Sheets to discuss U.S.-Russian economic relations during Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\nThe two meetings, which have not been previously reported, reveal a wider circle of high-powered connections that Butina sought with American political leaders and special interest groups.\nThe think tank, Center for the National Interest, had urged Donald Trump to improve US-Russian relations and to retreat from \u201cEurasian conflicts\u201d in December 2016. In a report on its earlier activities to improve Russia ties in 2013-2015, CNI outlined meetings it had taken with Obama administration officials during a time when Barack Obama himself pursued a similar policy. The meeting took place near the end of that time, in April 2015. The meeting was ostensibly set up to discuss Torshin\u2019s new appointment as deputy central bank governor.\nThe timing of this meeting seems significant. By this time, Russia had annexed Crimea more than a year earlier, and overtly invaded eastern Ukraine seven months prior to the meeting. Sanctions had already been applied to Russia, but Obama still wanted to pursue friendlier ties. Torshin\u2019s meeting with Fischer could be explained as a way to coordinate banking systems, but sending an undersecretary of state to a meeting with Torshin signals something more significant.\nHowever, the streak of presidential na\u00efvet\u00e9 on Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t start there, and it didn\u2019t end there either. Butina\u2019s presence as a potential spy is certainly interesting, but so is Torshin\u2019s, who also figures into the \u201cit was the NRA\u2019s fault\u201d narrative. If the Obama administration was granting her and Torshin access to the Undersecretary for International Affairs, it\u2019s tough to blame the NRA or the GOP for a lack of due diligence in engaging with either one of them. Torshin didn\u2019t end up on a sanctions list until April of this year, long after the NRA distanced themselves from him.\nLieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in March, expressing his concern with the NRA\u2019s relationship to Torshin and noting that Torshin \u201cacted as a liaison\u201d during a December 2015 visit to Moscow by several NRA attended by board members.\nHow deeply disturbing is it, then, that the Obama administration had made itself available to Torshin eight months earlier?

Obama put a higher priority on engagement with Putin than he did on stopping their hostile intelligence operations in the US, as demonstrated by this meeting and the several opportunities Obama turned down to fight fire with fire.\nAnd now it looks as though they didn\u2019t bother to vet Butina before allowing Fischer and Sheets to meet with her.

The sound of helplessness in your voices has permeated my subconscious all week.\nI wish we could help all of you. I wish that every person who\u2019s drowning under a mountain of medical debt right now could be helped by this program we\u2019ve started. But that sad reality is that with nearly one in four Americans struggling with medical bills right now, we are barely scratching the surface by paying off bills for a mere 600 of you.\nIf there is one thing I have learned this week it\u2019s this, the current state of our nation\u2019s healthcare system is as broken as some of the dozens of people who have called to talk this week.\nThere was James Glasscock who emailed on Tuesday. James nearly lost his sight a few years ago in an accident. He was hospitalized for a week and was eventually sent a bill for $398,999.98. How many people could afford to pay a bill like that?\nJames went on to say that he\u2019s doing the best he can to make ends meet. Like so many others he does not qualify for Medicare coverage. Even if he did, it wouldn\u2019t erase the hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt he owes. James\u2019 wife works full time and he\u2019s started driving for Uber just so they can put food on the table.\nThere\u2019s another common theme that\u2019s emerged this week as I\u2019ve sat here listening to your stories. All of you want to pay off these bills, but for so many different reasons you\u2019re stuck.\nThis year alone, hundreds of thousands of you will be forced into bankruptcy because of medical debt. Most Americans say they couldn\u2019t afford to pay off a hospital bill as small as $400. And a majority of these people have insurance. But shrinking coverage and rising costs are catching people off guard when they get sick. Suddenly you find yourself drowning in debt.\nI\u2019ve heard stories of people who have had to sell their homes to settle medical bills. Stories of people who have tried to sell their homes to pay off medical debt but can\u2019t because their bank has placed a lien on the property, it\u2019s the sobering reality so many of you are facing.\nSince Tuesday, I\u2019ve listened to 78 voicemails.\nRicky Eads called to talk about a logging accident he was in a few years ago. He broke all of his ribs and ended up nearly dying in the hospital. After eight days he was finally released. But now Ricky has been sent a $90,000 medical bill that he has two months to pay.

{"prefix": "Lo-Fi (Low Fidelity) is at present incorrectly assumed to be a genre of music. During its inception lo-fi was more akin to a type of sound rather than a style of music. However, over the years, lo-fi has somewhat become a standard genre of music that is known to be popular amongst \u201cbedroom musicians\u201d or people producing music from their homes as opposed to studios.\nLo-fi was heavily criticised by both critics and the general audience when it first came onto the scene. The so-called \u201clo-fi aesthetic\u201d would arise unintentionally during sound engineering and was characterised as being undesirable. Some of the first musicians to experiment with lo-fi did so somewhat by accident. The likes of Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, Beck, and Robert Stevie Moore were among the first. Moore is today regarded as one of the pioneers of the genre.\nOut of all the artists associated with lo-fi back then, only Moore was producing music in his home, which ultimately resulted in the overall aesthetic. While Moore's name isn't known as widely, his work has influenced Beck, Guided by Voices, and Ariel Pink.\nBy the start of the 1990s, lo-fi would become a radio mainstay by finding a place in the grunge scene. Grunge musicians wanted their music to sound rough and low effort. The \u201caesthetic\u201d would prove to be as important in the grunge scene as the music itself.\nMoving forward, lo-fi found itself a new home in jazz rap, a genre filled with producers sampling classic jazz artists. Selectively sampling parts from 50s jazz and then looping it endlessly became a common industry practice in jazz rap.\nSo, where is lo-fi now? It's still here and has finally become a genre in its own right. Developments in technology over the past two decades has given rise to more bedroom musicians and created the electronic musician. The rise of personal computers and modern production capabilities has allowed more and more people to start dabbling in the genre by producing tracks from multiple samples.\nBut how did lo-fi finally make it into the mainstream? As music continued to evolve, demand arose at the turn of the last century for a different kind of music.\nThe purpose of a lo-fi track in this day and age is to be a simple song that you don't need to think about while you're listening to it. It's just the same sample (usually the best part) played on repeat over a beat with some effects such as that of a cassette deck or vinyl scratches added into the mix.", "gold_completion": " The overall result is a song that doesn't require you to think about it. Instead, it sets the mood for a situation where you're almost procrastinating about the music you're listening to, making it a great genre to listen to while working or studying.\nJazz and lo-fi still continue to have a relationship, with the former being one of the cores of mainstream lo-fi music today. And while lo-fi still continues to be used as a production technique in genres such as \u201ctrip hop\u201d and \u201cchillhop\u201d, it cannot be denied that lo-fi has carved out a place for itself over the years. The democratic nature of the internet has truly allowed amateur and hobbyist musicians to carry the genre.\nSo be it at the next hangout with your friends, or an intense study session, lo-fi could be exactly what you're looking for. Allow it to drone away in the background while you do literally anything else.", "no_wm_completion": "\nToday, listeners will be able to find a lot of lo-fi tracks just about everywhere. Most of these tracks are free of the traditional production aspects present in contemporary music and are quite simple with no features added. Many lo-fi tracks come with no lyrics and they are basically just samples.\nIn the past, the lo-fi movement was known for its simplicity. But as the genre evolved, music enthusiasts began to question if producing the music without vocals or other features was the best practice. However, today it's become clear that this was the best practice.\nNot only have people become familiar with the genres music without vocals, but they also want a lo-fi track to listen to alone. Just like vinyl back in the nineties, people are keen on listening to lo-fi music. Many of them also listen to it while they're on the move, often the way we do today.

Unfortunately for future musicians of the genre, lo-, is still considered a sort-for-naught by a lot prospective musicians. However, lo-, is becoming quite lucrative an industry.

{"prefix": "2 What Is the Percent of Profit Margin That Retailers Expect From Jewelry?\n4 What Is a Reasonable Profit Margin?\nProperty management companies range from gargantuan firms that manage thousands of apartments, shopping malls and commercial complexes to small firms that specialize in vacation rentals with only 10 or so houses. Whether small or large, increasing profits is a goal. If you're considering starting a property management company or improving your own property management business, there are several ways you can do so and turn a profit.\nIncrease the number of properties, and your revenues will increase. If the operating margins are maintained, each additional property results in an additional percentage falling to profits. For example, if each property generates $10,000 in revenues and has a 35 percent gross margin -- the percentage of expenses related to that property -- then $6,500 of additional profit is generated.\nProperty management services include such efforts as marketing, maintenance, and renting out or selling the use of the property. Providing additional services results in additional profits as long as your expenses for providing the service are lower than the revenues generated. An apartment complex property management company could offer concierge services to the renters. A vacation home rental company might decide to have personalized meet-and-greet upon check-in.\nBroadening the types of properties is an alternative way to increase profits. If your business handles short-term sub-leases for apartments, you could offer that same service for townhouses and condos.\nProperty management companies generate revenues from the owners of the properties they manage and from the guests, renters or lessees who occupy the properties. Increasing rates to the owners when management contracts are up for renewal increases revenues and therefore profits. Keep in mind that current owners may decide to contract with someone else if the rate increase is too high. The rates generated from the guests or those who pay to occupy the properties also can be increased.\nRevenues are generated by the rate or fee for occupying the space times the number of spaces occupied. In the case of an apartment building where each apartment leases for $500 per month and 200", "gold_completion": " of the 250 apartments are rented, revenues generated are $100,000. If occupancy increases to 225 apartments, revenues are $112,500; that occupancy rate would increase profits by $12,500. However, if you incurred any expenses in getting those units rented, those expenses would be netted from the $12,500.\nDecreasing expenses increases profits as long as the cost-cutting doesn't affect revenues. In the short term, it probably won't; in the long term, it may be a different story. Decreasing advertising could result in fewer properties being leased. Decreasing maintenance efforts might result in tenants leaving for other accommodations.\nJensen, Katie. \"How Can Property Management Companies Increase Profit?\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/can-property-management-companies-increase-profit-50056.html.

In the case of an apartment rental property, the company might charge half of the rent for each unit rented during a full month and then charge the remainder of the rent in monthly installments.

Otherwise, the company would need to generate about $7,000 in revenue to cover the cost of the security deposit and first month's rent each month.\nIn addition to increasing revenues above the rent, property owners may decide to increase costs beyond the rates or fees charged by an existing property management company.

{"prefix": "The NBA is taking a rare day off on Thanksgiving, which should at least satisfy Stan Van Gundy. But for diehard fans, getting through the holiday will be a struggle.\nAt ThePostGame, we are doing our part to entertain you ... by matching Thanksgiving foods with the personality of NBA players. That means entrees, sides, desserts -- we're putting on a full-court press. Maybe consider reading this after your big meal. It'll make you hungry -- hopefully not to eat LeBron James or Stephen Curry.\nLeBron is still the face of the NBA. Yes, he can sometimes be bland, but no good NBA argument can be made without mentioning LeBron in the same way that there's no good Thanksgiving meal unless you have turkey.\nGreen is a great complement to a great team. Stuffing is the most important role player on Thanksgiving. You can't rely only on stuffing for a meal, but you'll move it around your plate and let it cover a ton of ground. It has a firm texture and can get messy.\nJust so smooth and sweet. Nothing makes your palate tingle like sweet potatoes.\nThis will slice up your Thanksgiving plate. Mashed potatoes will find their way to every crevice.\nHarder than sweet potatoes, but still gets the job done. Squash definitely has its moments, but it can be inconsistent.\nNo, not everyone likes Durant, but he doesn't care. Those who do like him think he's one of the most important players in the NBA. Cranberry sauce isn't for everyone, but those who like it won't do Thanksgiving without it.\nThere isn't much on the surface of a roll, but forget Thanksgiving. What holiday meal is complete without traditional bread to complement the whole meal (well, Passover, but that's neither here nor there). The roll can defend against anything from too much wine to too much gravy.\nSweeter and a bit softer than a roll, but still a great two-way player.\nKlay Thompson or gravy would have a tougher times on their own. But with stars like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant or turkey and stuffing, they are an crucial part of the offense. Thompson is gravy for the Warriors. On top of having two MVPs, Golden State has a lights-out spot-up shooter to rain all over the opponent.\nOlder generations might scoff at Antetokounmpo's lankiness, but in today's health-focused generation, he's a rising star. There are a lot of nutrients in there and look at that length!\nNot necessarily a common Thanksgiving dish, but Harden is cooking up something special right now. Unless Lil B curses him again, Harden is going to keep stirring that pot.\nMost people don't get excited about DeRozan, but he's a consistent star for one of the NBA's most consistent teams. He delivers night-in, night-out even if he's not the most marketable face. And besides, his hometown of Los Angeles would love this.\nYou're not sure how good he actually is, but as time goes on, it's hard to keep Wall out of the discussion for best players in the NBA. Brussel sprouts sound bad when you're young, but over time, you realize just how legit they are.\nYou're not sure if you need this until", "gold_completion": " you eat it and realize even though summer barbecues are long over, corn can complement anything. Corn has been doing it for so long in so many situations. The same goes for Horford, who is at the forefront of the Celtics' surprising 2017-18 despite the loss of Gordon Hayward.\nEveryone overlooks the green beans. Some people don't even think it deserves the spotlight of the Thanksgiving meal. But green beans keep coming back for more every year and are on a mission to prove they belong.\nYou're never sure if these ingredients are going to line up. You're not sure if anyone will like it. But mixing all these things sounds amazing, so you're going to do it anyway.\nThe unicorns who aren't quite ready for the main course. However, we can't wait to watch them play and indulge in them as much as possible.

The rest of Cleveland has to play like a third ballplayer to support them. And that might not get enough credit. In crunch time, the rest of his supporting cast might just need to take some of the scoring load away to keep him going.\nAnd you know what? That's not a weakness about them. It's just how the game works now.\nDwyane Wade has been a staple of one of the NBA's most exciting teams for more than a decade. His defense is still a little on the weak side, but if Miami wanted to do it, they could. The real trick for the season might become figuring out when he needs to come off the bench.\n", "gen_completion": " after, or ever come to think of this ... the whole salami concept? The texture is strange when put next to other Thanksgiving items. But when served up on such well-preseason'd roll/sash, what is there can't be beat by a great roll/sash combination? (Full disclaimer before answering: Yes, sir. I'm putting Sash vs Ham on turkey. If this happens for another few years, well, then we can talk).\nPerhaps people wouldn't think of the WutZup as a Thanksgiving staple. But when combined with chicken and waffles, what about WutZup vs Ham? Or Pepper Jack vs Ham? Pepper Jack is super salty. But WutZup ... that might taste okay. Some kind will slip on, that we can count with some level skepticism. But no doubt about K-Pop or Hot-Pockets, these things got their due at Thanksgiving.

{"prefix": "Community colleges are a vital part of America\u2019s opportunity structure, not least because they often provide a way into higher education for adults from less advantaged backgrounds. Each year there are around 10 million undergraduates enrolled at public, two-year colleges. Among first-generation students, nearly 38 percent attend community colleges, compared to 20 percent of students with college-educated parents.\nCredentials from community colleges\u2014whether short vocational courses or two-year associate degrees\u2014can be valuable in the labor market. In theory, community colleges also provide an on-ramp for those seeking a bachelor\u2019s degree; in fact, four out of five students enrolling intend to get a 4-year degree.\nBut the potential of community college is often unrealized. Many students are not ready. Quality varies. Pathways are often unclear and/or complex. Only about 40 percent of those enrolling earn a degree within six years. Just 15 percent acquire a 4-year degree, according to analyses by Doug Shapiro and Afet Dundar at the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.\nThe degree of alignment and integration between community and four-year colleges is much greater in some states than others. Some use common course numbering for 2- and 4-year institutions, which helps students find the classes they need without racking up costly excess credits. In others, universities and community colleges have tried to align their curriculum to ensure that students\u2019 transfer credits will be accepted.\nIndividual institutions like Queensborough College (part of the CUNY system) and Miami-Dade College have streamlined course sequences to help their students stay on track to transfer into 4-year schools, as Thomas Bailey, Shanna Jaggers, and Davis Jenkins describe in their book, Redesigning America\u2019s Community Colleges.

Many who struggle at high school may begin to flourish in the first year or two of post-secondary education. As their skills are upgraded, so their opportunities should widen. But too often they become trapped in the silos of post-secondary education. We should continue to support efforts like pathway programs that explicitly attempt to build bridges between community colleges and high-quality four year institutions through the creation of clear and consistent major-specific program maps. Such programs allow students starting out at community colleges to easily chart out the specific, clear, and coherent set of steps needed to eventually finish their post-secondary education with a four-year degree.\nThe mission of community colleges since their inception a century ago has been to broaden access to education.

Last year New York State provided more than $250 million in loans to transfer students, nearly doubling the amount compared with three years earlier. Most significantly, the funding supports additional tuition assistance, which extends access.\nFlorida leads the nation in the number of community college students receiving a 4-year degree.

Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive or of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favourite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favours,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the non-profit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named this week by President Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 per cent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span.

LOUIS \u2014 Once in awhile, in my role as a movie critic, other grand opportunities present themselves and my fortuitous meeting with \u201cPawn Sacrifice\u2019s\u201d producer at an industry cocktail party rates as one such opportunity.\nThe St. Louis Chess Club, located in the city\u2019s Central West End, sponsored the party Sept. 3, prior to the St. Louis red carpet premier of the movie \u201cPawn Sacrifice\u201d starring Tobey Maguire, as American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer.\nThe film is about chess Grand Master Bobby Fischer\u2019s triumphant win over Russian Boris Spassky at the 1972 World Championship in Reykjavik, Iceland. The film\u2019s producer, Gail Katz, was present at the party to promote the film.\nI asked if I could have a couple of minutes to talk with Katz. I was delighted that I had her all to myself for almost a half hour. When she walked in the room, she had the attention of every woman present. She was tall and thin, with long hair peppered with gray, and looked very elegant in a chic black cocktail dress trimmed in black leather.\nKatz has a BA in economics from the University of California Berkeley and a MBA from the Yale School of Management. I asked how she ever got involved in the film industry. She said that she thought she might end up working on Wall Street but that she was raised in Beverly Hills and worked at a studio one summer while in college.\nShe got \u201chooked on film,\u201d she said.\nKatz heads Gail Katz Productions. She has worked at New World Pictures, where she was Vice President of Finance, then Vice President of Production.

She was an executive producer on the ABC drama/comedy \u201cCashmere Mafia,\u201d which Gail Katz Productions produced. Currently, Katz is an adjunct professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts.\nAs a producer, Katz is responsible for everything from conceiving or finding the idea; securing financing; hiring writers, actors, directors, staff and crews; marketing; and distribution.\nI asked how she came up with the idea for \u201cPawn Sacrifice.\u201d She said that in 1972 she worked at her father\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles and on the way home every night they turned on the radio to hear how Bobby Fischer did that day.\nShe pitched the idea to two writers who were on board immediately. They came up with the storyline, she recalled.\nTobey Maguire was always her first choice to play Bobby. She thinks he even looks like Bobby Fischer. Liev Schreiber, who plays Boris Spassky, also bears a strong resemblance to Spassky.\nKatz hired David Fincher to direct but Fincher had so many commitments that the start of filming kept getting put off, she said. After two years, Fincher graciously bowed out so Katz could hire Edward Zwick to direct.\nKatz said that the art director and costume designer did an awesome job of recreating the 1960s. She said that Bobby Fischer was a fanatic about his attire", "gold_completion": " and that, at the time, most chess players weren\u2019t concerned about their manner of dress yet Bobby thought that it was important to dress well to represent the game.\nThe film was shot in Montreal, Canada; New York City; Santa Monica, Calif.; and, Reykjavik, Iceland. From Katz\u2019s initial idea to the St. Louis premier, it took 11 years of hard work to create and then get \u201cPawn Sacrifice\u201d to the public.\nI was very impressed with Ms. Katz.

They don\u2019t really play by the rules of chess, so for the movie they had to improvise.\nWith the story of an American beating a Russian in a game of chess, in this day and age it is no big deal to think of a black card at the end of the game.

For instance, the free picture effects plus app duplicates the effect in the camera with the exception of adding watercolor and illustration.

There have been 68 men and one woman executed in Georgia since 1976, CBS affiliate WGCL reports.\nSallie was the 46th inmate put to death by lethal injection, according to officials.\nSallie was convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of John Lee Moore in March 1990. His first conviction and death sentence were overturned because his attorney had a conflict of interest.\nAt his second trial in 2001, a woman eventually chosen as a juror lied during jury selection and failed to disclose domestic violence, messy divorces and a child custody battle that were \u201cbizarrely similar\u201d to Sallie\u2019s case, his lawyers said. They add she later bragged to his attorneys\u2019 investigator that she persuaded her divided peers to vote unanimously for death.\nThe defense team made those arguments in a clemency petition to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, urging it to act as a \u201cfail safe\u201d against a miscarriage of justice. But the board, the only authority in Georgia with power to commute a death sentence, declined to spare Sallie\u2019s life following a clemency hearing Monday.\nSallie\u2019s lawyers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the scheduled execution, but it declined. They argued that the high court\u2019s ruling in a pending Texas case with ineffective counsel issues could remove the procedural bars that are keeping the lower federal courts from considering their juror-bias claims.\nAttorneys for the state have argued the Texas case isn\u2019t similar enough that its outcome would affect Sallie, particularly because that case doesn\u2019t involve a federal petition that wasn\u2019t filed on time. Furthermore, they argue, even if the issues were identical, the federal appeals court in Atlanta is bound by its own precedent - which doesn\u2019t allow such an extraordinary admission of the procedurally barred evidence - and not by the future possibility of new precedent from the Supreme Court.\nSallie\u2019s lawyers also have argued in a state court petition that carrying out his execution would violate his constitutional rights.

{"prefix": "When Wall Street withdrew its support for auction-rate securities, many investors discovered their cash is trapped. Their brokers told them their investments in instruments that were marketed as cash-equivalents were suddenly illiquid. Issuers who depended on the securities for financing are being told by their banks that they must refinance, and of course hand over deal fees to the very institutions that allowed the markets to collapse. And now many want to know why the auctions were in such dire condition that the banks decided the cost of supporting them was not longer acceptable.\n\u201cHow long did they know the auctions were on life support?\u201d one investor with nearly half-a-million dollars in now illiquid auction-rate securities asked DealBreaker.\nThe immediate cause of the auction failures was the pullback of the banks and brokerages. In mid-February the financial institutions conducting the auctions stopped acting as principals or buyers of excess ARS inventory. Investors and issuers were caught off guard, surprised by the sudden change that occurred nearly simultaneously and without warning. Even some within the financial institutions were caught off guard, with brokers learning only after the fact that their auction desks were allowing the auctions to fail.\n\u201cWall Street executives have defended their conduct, saying losses on holdings such as mortgage assets have curtailed their ability to use their balance sheets to support faltering markets,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Randall Smith and Liz Rappaport report in their article today about a large bond marketer lashing out against Wall Street over the auction failures.\nBut this raises the question of why the markets were faltering in the first place. In our earlier reporting, we revealed how accounting changes may have set some corporate buyers running for the exits from this market. More recent conversations with a broader array of bond traders and dealers points toward another possiblility\u2014the market never had enough buyer demand to support itself and has been dependent on stabilization from the banks for a very long time.\n\u201cThe truth is there was no natural auction success rate.", "gold_completion": " But for the banks acting as market makers, these auctions would have failed from the get go,\u201d a bond trader told DealBreaker.\nRather than merely acting as buyers of the last resort, the financial institutions have been consistently called upon to stabilize the ARS market.

But with balance sheet capital at a premium due to recent losses, the banks decided that the fees received for structuring the auctions and managing clients money in ARS were did not justify deploying the capital necessary to support the market.\nIf these bond traders are correct about the way the ARS market operated, Wall Street may soon find itself the subject of yet another round of lawsuits and investigations by authorities.\nDid The Auditors Trigger The Sell-Off of Auction Rate Securities?\nAuction Rate Securities: Were They Sold As 'Highly Liquid'?\nDo Auction Rate Securities Lawsuits Really Face Tough Hurdles?", "no_wm_completion": " They got into it looking to make money just as the rest of Wall Street,\u201d says a senior dealer with an investment bank who now has a $1.8 billion ARS portfolio.\nWe have also been unable to obtain comment from JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America.

The University of Michigan battle cry is popular with many in the Niles area, but it hits a stop sign at 1205 S. 11th St., where John Dampeer operates his State Farm Insurance office. Dampeer's Good-Neighbor surroundings include a picture of former Notre Dame football coach Ara Parseghian and a poster depicting photos of a century's worth of Fightin' Irish football captains. Closer examination of the latter reveals that Dampeer isn't simply a fan. His mug is displayed for the year 1972, when Dampeer earned All-American status. Like most football linemen, the former offensive tackle didn't receive a great deal of recognition in college. But he managed to impress the one person who mattered most -- the former Susan Combs, a Sturgis native and a student at Saint Mary's College when the two first met. Today, they've been married 34 years and have two grown children. \"I tell people I made a big mistake at Notre Dame. I fell in love with a girl from Michigan,'' he said. \"I'm still here, with the gray (skies) instead of the sunshine.'' The sunshine would be Texas, where the 57-year-old Dampeer grew up.

He said, 'You need to contact this guy.'\u00e6\" At the time, Dampeer knew nothing about the university and its football tradition. But he did know it had a strong academic program and, unlike a lot of universities, it didn't have separate dormitories for its athletes. \"I liked that.

She was a star.'' Of his time at Notre Dame, Dampeer says he has \"an awful lot of (the same) things I remember'' -- just not the game itself. \"I remember the feeling of the crowd,'' Dampeer said. \"I remember the sound of the bells at noon.

{"prefix": "This is the debut week of the Z10 on AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, and at the same $200 price point as the iPhone, Android smartphones, and Windows Phone devices, I wonder if consumers will choose BlackBerry.\nAs T-Mobile joins Verizon and AT&T this week with the release of the BlackBerrry Z10, I continue to wonder why someone would buy a Z10 over an iPhone, Windows Phone, or Android smartphone. I've been enjoying the Z10 for over a month, but I like using my Nokia N9, and we all know how well MeeGo is doing right now.\nI have a great job where I get to try out lots of phones and thus part of the appeal of the Z10 is the new, fresh BlackBerry 10 operating system. I've been able to sideload many Android apps I use daily, but we can't expect consumers to do this , so there is still lots of work to do in BlackBerry World. Then again, the OS packs a lot and you don't always need a ton of apps.\nAs I previously mentioned , the BlackBerry Z10 is an outstanding communications device and even though I have some amazing phones to test I keep going back to using the Z10.\nThe iPhone 5 is a solid smartphone, and for most people that come to me for advice, that is the phone they end up buying and they are often overwhelmingly pleased. The Galaxy S III, soon the S4, the Note II, the HTC One, and various Motorola Droid products are all solid Android smartphones. Nokia's Windows Phones are excellent smartphones with lots of value-added services. With all of these products that have a huge selection of apps I am a bit worried that consumers might pass on the Z10.\nThe BlackBerry Z10 hardware is nothing especially unique, but it is solid and functional. I like the smaller 4.2 inch display, compared to the monster screen devices, and the form factor as it is very pocketable. The camera is OK, but those found", "gold_completion": " on the iPhone 5, Lumia 920, and Galaxy Note II/SIII/S4 are all better.\nI imagine people who like BlackBerry devices will like the Z10 and upcoming Q10, but some previous BlackBerry owners have already moved on to something else, and it is going to be tough to bring them back. The BB10 experience is unique, but it also requires people to learn new gestures, and we didn't see lots of excitement for the PlayBook that has the same gesture-based UI. Palm's webOS had a similar gesture-based OS and didn't fare well in the marketplace. I believe BlackBerry has more interest than Palm in making sure the Z10 succeeds.\nThe Z10 will be out on Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile this week, so we'll have to see what consumers think of it in a few weeks. At a price the same as leading smartphones, do you find enough compelling about the BlackBerry Z10 to justify a purchase?", "no_wm_completion": " on other Android devices make me much happier.\nThe main difference to the iPhone from my use with AT&T is the ability to use the BlackBerry keyboard as an SMS input method instead of the tiny keyboard on Android's smartphones.

That would be a big difference from the old BlackBerry Z10 where Android users used the keyboard to send text messages.\nFor those who are like me, who need and constantly send SMS messages, the BlackBerry keyboard is a welcome feature.\nI would like to see some BlackBerry Apps for the BlackBerry phone. I would like to use email in Windows Phone, as I do for my iPhone. For business use there are few good e-mail apps on the PlayBook and Windows Phone phones, just to name a few.

Not everyone needs that kind if feature, or has friends who are willing, or interested in acquiring a BlackBerry now .\nSo I'm very impressed with BlackBerry as a company. But don\u2018t forget Android devices are now $100 going down from the $550 listed starting prices for Verizon. I would choose that a lot more even with BlackBerry software updates. The HTC Evoe 4 GB $600, or Nokia S3 Dual Core 4 GB $500 are strong contenders if consumers choose these as their daily drivers.

Iona Technologies announced membership as a Strategic Developer and board member of the Eclipse Foundation last week.\nOfficials at Nokia said their company, based in Espoo, Finland, will lead a project to create a framework for mobile Java developer tools, including complete tooling support for J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition).

That one cleverly used a family breakup to explore Scotland\u2019s independence movement.\nLazy Fair looks at the execution and aftermath of a heist somewhere in the world (Paul Tei\u2019s costumes suggest the Middle East). The caper plays out in flashback. In the present, a decade after the theft went all kinds of wrong, the three plotters reunite and turn on each other.\nRip (Ken Clement) is the conniving ringleader who wound up with the spoils: what looks like an empty box, though Monkey assures him it contains the spirit of money. Otto (Andy Quiroga), a tightly wound worrier, suffers from memory lapses because of an injury he suffered in the bomb blast 10 years earlier \u2014 at least, that\u2019s how Rip tells it. Sandra (Meredith Bartmon) has remained friendly with Otto, but she has a tendency to vanish and reappear. As for Rip, he\u2019s dead to her, and she\u2019d like to make that literal.\nThe three rationalize their crime initially by deciding the rich have way too much money, so a little redistribution of wealth is in order.

The idea that friends shouldn\u2019t discuss money comes up more than once.\nLazy Fair is a relatively short play overstuffed with ideas. Though Reyna, a gifted theater artist, writes good dialogue, the beginning of the play is so deliberately puzzling that the audience takes too long to get invested in the characters and story.

Drudge Report said the operation would take place on Friday in New York.\nJagger himself tweeted that he was \"devastated\" to delay the tour of 17 shows in the US and Canada that were due to start later this month and run until June.\n\"I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can,\" he added. \"I really hate letting you down like this.\"\nDoctors said that if the surgery goes well, Jagger could be back on his feet relatively rapidly.\nHeart surgeon and US television presenter Dr Mehmet Oz said \"about about 10 percent of people at his age have problem with their aortic valve which can lead to chest pain and dizziness.\n\"About 50 percent of people who have the problem will die in a couple of years if they don't have the surgery,\" he added in a video posted on Twitter.\nHe said traditionally the operation has been done with open heart surgery but \"new techniques allow us to do these procedures with minimal invasion with a catheter (tube). You can sneak your way up there and replace the old value with a new one.\n\"This allows the person to be back home in a day or two.

{"prefix": "Amid declining budgets and increasing priorities, Yale\u2019s library system has begun to deepen partnerships with peer institutions to address upcoming challenges.\nAs the University prepares for the arrival of 800 more students over the next four years, ensuring that students continue to have positive experiences at Yale\u2019s libraries is an immediate concern for University Librarian Susan Gibbons.\n\u201cWith the new colleges coming on line, we are going to need new staffing to support 800 additional students,\u201d Gibbons said, adding that more librarians will be needed to help with undergraduate outreach programs and in majors where students have senior theses. Gibbons also estimated that with the coming increase in the University\u2019s undergraduate student body, the library will need to spend an additional $1.2 million for electronic content licenses annually.\nThe challenges are exacerbated by the library\u2019s funding structure. According to Gibbons, about three-quarters of the libraries\u2019 budget comes from the return on over 600 library-specific endowments that are managed by the University Investments Office, with the rest coming from general appropriations provided by the Office of the Provost.\nSince the money coming from the endowment is designated for purposes that can be fairly narrow \u2014 such as a gift specifically for adding books written in shorthand or adding materials related to seafaring adventures \u2014 many of the library\u2019s new initiatives can only be funded by what amounts to a quarter of its budget, Gibbons said.\nAs a result of its reliance on returns from the endowment, the library is more susceptible to fluctuations in market performance than the University at large, whose overall spending from the endowment accounts for a third of its total annual revenue.\nConsequently, the library is especially hurt by cases of major disruptions such as the 2008 financial crisis. Data submitted to the Association of Research Libraries indicates that Yale\u2019s total annual library expenditure had decreased by over $10 million \u2014 nearly 15 percent of its total budget \u2014 between 2005 and 2015.\nGibbons also noted that between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, the general appropriations portion of the library\u2019s budget was reduced by about 30 percent. ARL statistics show a decrease in the library\u2019s staffing by nearly 100 members between 2009 and 2010.\nFor Gibbons and other librarians, collaboration nowadays has become a much more active process beyond the adoption of best practices at other libraries. In fact, librarians across different universities interviewed said collaboration is now an integral part of how research libraries operate today.\nHarvard University Librarian Sarah Thomas expressed a similar sentiment, noting that while the 2008 crisis has created challenges, the downturn motivated libraries to pursue innovative approaches to accessing and using information.\nLibrarians interviewed cited the significant expansion of the BorrowDirect service \u2014 an intercollegiate system that allows students from participating schools to borrow library resources from other institutions \u2014 as an example of the increase in collaboration among research libraries.\nThe idea of a service like BorrowDirect was first discussed in the early 1990s with support from senior librarians at Yale, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, according to BorrowDirect\u2019s website. Since its initial launch in 1999, the service has expanded to encompass the entire Ivy League and four other institutions: MIT, Duke,", "gold_completion": " Johns Hopkins and the University of Chicago.\nData from the BorrowDirect website indicated that about 2.5 million requests had been fulfilled through the program by fiscal 2015, a near doubling from the late 2000s. Today, the program annually supplies 250,000 library items from a catalogue of almost 70 million volumes and has reduced the average turnaround times for borrowing from other universities from 29 days to four.\nAnother major breakthrough in intercollegiate exchange is arXiv, a server founded at Cornell in 1991 that allows scientists to quickly share research and stake intellectual claim on new findings even before officially publishing their articles. Yale is one of the member institutions of the server, which now hosts almost 1.2 million research studies with 139 million downloads.\nAccording to Duke University Librarian Deborah Jakubs, the idea of cooperative collection development has been around for decades. While the school is a relatively recent addition to the BorrowDirect system, it has long maintained partnerships with three neighboring schools within 25 miles.", "no_wm_completion": " Yale and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\nThomas credited Robert E. Ralston, a professor of library services at the University of Virginia, and his colleague and now President Richard S. Simcoe for initiating BorrowDirect in 1995, which was later acquired by the Association of Research Libraries in 2006.\nThe service now provides students with the ability to borrow books from over 3,300 libraries in more than 600 cities within the United States and abroad, as well as thousands of library-specific resources.\n\u201cAll of these libraries have had the ability to access and borrow each other\u2019s resources to get things back quickly,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI know that this happened before \u2014 I would say 10 or 15 years ago before BorrowDirect, so it\u2019s a real growth area.\u201d\nOther examples of library collaboration cited by the librarians include the online version of Cornell University\u2019s student newspaper, the Daily Sun, making", "gen_completion": " Stanford university, Cornell, American University and the Universities at St. Edmunds College.

The agency also curtailed enforcement of distributors, the report found, and infighting inside the agency affected the way cases were handled.\nThe 324-page report, the culmination of an 18-month investigation of alleged pill dumping in West Virginia, shows how mistakes and lack of oversight led to a massive influx of pills there, much of which ultimately fueled the black market sale and illegal abuse of opioids, including oxycodone.\nThe Controlled Substances Act requires distributors and the DEA to diligently report and track data about such drugs, and the report found that neither did. West Virginia has been the epicenter of the opioid crisis; the state has the highest overdose death rate in the country.\nThe committee investigated the nation\u2019s three largest drug distributors: Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson Corp. The report said the companies combined sent more than 900 million doses of hydrocodone and oxycodone to West Virginia from 2005 to 2016.

He said the changes have led to an increase in investigations into, and prosecutions of, manufacturers, distributors and providers during the past three years.\nStarting in 2005, the DEA held one-on-one meetings with distributors to remind them of their legal obligation to prevent pills from being diverted to the black market, and the agency sent letters to all distributors in 2006 and 2007 to reiterate that obligation, according to the report.\nThose letters did not work, the report concluded.

The report said that many of the distributors shipped pills to pharmacies with no regard for how many pills a store should need to have in stock based on the population it serves; during a two-week period in 2008, Cardinal increased what it sent to a pharmacy in Williamson, W.Va., more than 1,500 percent.\nThe report also said that distributors continued to pump pills into pharmacies even after", "gold_completion": " it became clear that doctors and physicians who practiced hundreds of miles from the pharmacies were writing suspicious prescriptions to be filled there.\nThe report found that the DEA\u2019s use of administrative enforcement actions against distributors plummeted from 58 in 2011, to five in 2015.\n\u201cOur bipartisan investigation revealed systemic failures by both distributors and the DEA that contributed to \u2014 and failed to abate \u2014 the opioid crisis in West Virginia,\u201d Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and ranking Democrat Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) said in a joint statement.\nThe report lists several legislative and policy recommendations, such as calling on Congress to create more stringent requirements for reporting suspicious orders.

In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) first detected a gravitational wave caused by two black holes spiralling towards one another and merging. Since then, theorists have been hard at work figuring out what such waves from other events and objects would look like.\nSome of the most exotic objects in physics, such as evaporating black holes, cosmic strings and even possible extra dimensions, would induce gravitational waves at much higher frequencies than we can currently detect.\nBut there is still hope that these elusive objects could leave a detectable signal, say Lucy McNeill and her colleagues Eric Thrane and Paul Lasky at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\nIf two people were floating near, say, a pair of merging black holes, the space between them would grow and shrink as space-time was stretched and distorted by gravitational waves.\nOnce the black holes merged and the waves ceased, this oscillation would stop \u2013 but the two people would be at a different distance apart to when they started. Memory of the gravitational waves would leave them slightly further apart or closer together.\nThis permanent distortion of space-time creates a signal 10 to 100 times weaker and with a frequency much lower than the original one from the oscillating gravitational wave. It could also extend in all directions, even if the gravitational waves themselves were be", "gold_completion": "amed in one specific direction.\nThe difference in frequency means that the kinds of event for which LIGO and similar detectors can spot gravitational waves will have too low a frequency for them to also pick up the memory signal.\nBut if there are astrophysical events that produce gravitational waves at frequencies too high for LIGO to spot, their memory signals might fall easily into the observatory\u2019s detection range, thus allowing us to pick them up. McNeill and her colleagues call these \u201corphan\u201d signals because the parent wave is not detectable.\nIn fact, memory signals could supply the first definitive proof that many objects that would emit high-frequency gravitational waves do exist. Even objects at the less-esoteric end of the spectrum, such as small primordial black holes, have not yet escaped the realm of theory.\nOrphan memory signals could represent a ray of light for those theories, allowing researchers to find high-frequency sources without looking for the sources themselves.", "no_wm_completion": "amed into the sky by something much farther away.\nEven if we are unable to detect new gravitational waves, the signal they leave could help us figure out something about the big bang itself or the evolution of galaxy cluster \u2013 a cluster of galaxies at the center of our own universe.\nThese tiny, hidden distortions could affect how light from distant objects passes through space-time, which could make it appear that distant objects have been closer to us than they really were.\nThe team used their algorithm and a new method of tracking objects in near-infrared and visible light \u2013 which is already in place on a number of telescopes \u2013 to calculate the time difference between two points in the sky that would be affected by their gravitational waves.\nThis new algorithm allows researchers to precisely calculate the time between two points in space-time to make predictions about the way light from these objects passes through space-time, the researchers say.\nUsing this new algorithm, the researchers are able to find distant galaxies which are", "gen_completion": "amed away ahead of the black holes moving towards them as they formed the binary pairing.

The booklet sat at Ryan Davis' vendor table, and enough people bought his pitch \u2014 and the \"rough\" of his new comic \u2014 to fund a limited run of a full-color glossy version.\nIn June, at the 2012 Denver Comic Con, he made more than 100 sales, enough to publish the next issue.\nDavis is a 30-year-old with a dream: He wants to break into the big time in the comic book industry. He and his partner, Colorado Springs artist Gunther Goltz, have come up with what they hope will be a winning story that will catch the attention of big names.\n\"There are basically two ways of breaking into the business,\" says Steven Seagle, the Colorado Springs-bred co-founder of Man of Action Studios (creators of Cartoon Network's Ben 10), supervising producer for Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-man series, and veteran comic book writer for both DC and Marvel Comics. \"You can either produce your own comic, or you can know someone in the business.\n\"If you produce your own comic,\" he advises, \"do it from top to bottom. Find a way to get it out to the world. Self-publish it. This is your calling card.\"\nVelvet Garden is based on a 1980s urban legend about a psychoactive video game machine called Polybius, released by the U.S. government as an experiment in mind control. Davis and Goltz will officially unveil the second issue Saturday, Aug. 25, at Escape Velocity, the comics-and-graphic-novels store where they both work. But they've been selling and giving out samples for several weeks.\nWith Velvet Garden, they're actually debuting the three-volume, 18-issue series with Volume No. 2. Davis, who wrote the story, and Goltz, the illustrator, decided that it would showcase the story line better than the first volume, a prequel that goes into the game's background.\n\"In the first issue, the reader learns about Hitler's experiments with mind control, and some of the machines he built, but we didn't want readers to think the series was a World War II story, because it's not,\" Davis says. \"So, we went with the second volume, which takes place in the '80s.\"\nThe first (chronologically) of the three-volume set is called Wicked Garden, and the last, which is set in Colorado Springs, is titled Neon Garden. All three will eventually be made into distinct graphic novels, each made up of six serialized comic books.\nThough he's been in the business for a decade, Davis has worked with the single focus of breaking into the industry for about a year. That started with co-creating a publishing company called Ruby Carriage, through which he produced several Internet-based comics before this current endeavor.\nHaving a central location or imprint where people can find all his work makes things easier, but doesn't cover all the bases. Seagle says most comic fans still want something they can hold, and publishers want to see good-quality artwork.\n\"The quality has got to be great. It has to be the same as, say, your favorite comic, but in an original voice only you can provide ...", "gold_completion": " you also have to basically give the thing away.\"\nOn that topic, they're well supported by Escape Velocity, which allows them to carry the comic in the store. \"Where I work ... I can't say enough. They're committed to getting graphic novels and comics out there,\" Davis says.\nTheir goal is to have all six issues of Velvet Garden completed and compiled into a graphic novel by the next Denver Comic Con, which runs from May 31 through June 2, 2013. Each issue they release locally brings them closer to that goal, with the profits from the previous issue funding the next.\nEven if they don't meet that goal, however, they'll have a body of work to show off and present to prospective publishers.\n\"The first question most comic book professionals ask, however, is: Have you already done one?\" says Seagle.\nTo that question, Davis and Goltz will be able to reply with a resounding, \"Yes. Want some copies?\"", "no_wm_completion": " and it has to make sense emotionally,\" Seagle says. \"People are going to read Velvet Garden because there's no good story there or nothing that can break apart the concept of the genre. And if they love it, they will buy it. The rest falls into place.\"\nThough these are new comic stories, the format has existed since 1941.\n\"There are people who call it 'classic comics' or 'classic tales,' but there were dozens of them, and they were written and drawn by different people,\" Seagle says. \"There's not a lot of continuity in them, but a lot of great stories. You can tell the story of an adventure, a romance, anything, in their own unique telling ...\"\nDavis thinks that there's still a place for classic comics and tales that retain their core qualities, especially in younger generations. \"I just think it's an under-explored genre,\" he says. \"We really want to put together the best 'classic'", "gen_completion": " something even crazier,\" says Robert Laudu, Ghatcher's store owner, where some 300 people are permitted per week.

It was his seventh of the season, and allowed Triggs to take the mound with a 1-0 lead before he even took the mound.\nAfter a red-hot April that saw him set a new Oakland record for most hits in the month, Lowrie seemed to carry over that success into the new month.\nBut following the home run allowed to Lowrie, Hernandez turned into the pitcher who has terrorized Oakland for years.\nEntering the night 25-10 with a 2.61 ERA in 47 career starts against the A\u0092s, Hernandez was sharp after the home run as he allowed just two hits after.\nThe A\u0092s chased him out of the game in the seventh after Matt Olson followed up a Khris Davis walk by doubling down the right field line to put runners on second and third with no outs and found a way to bring in two runs off Nick Vincent on an infield hit and a ground out to cut the lead to 5-3.\nA\u0092s players were excited following the announcement that the team would open the 2019 season in Japan, an experience that is sure to be memorable for the many young players on the team.

Since then, Manaea has emerged into one of the top young pitchers in baseball, making a statement just over a week ago when he threw a no-hitter at the Oakland Coliseum against the Boston Red Sox.\nGiven the way Manaea has performed this this season, there\u0092s a good chance he gets the nod in one of those games.\n", "gold_completion": "He just hopes Dane, 28, is still stationed there by that time. He was in Spain the previous two year before transferring to Japan, so the possibility for another transfer is a realistic one.\nWith the opportunity to have Dane in the stands, Manaea said he wants the ball and is definitely hoping manager Bob Melvin selects him to start one of the games.\nMelvin, who managed the A\u0092s when the club opened the season in Japan back in 2012, is looking forward to the trip.\nNo corresponding roster move was made as of Tuesday night, but Brett Anderson was in the A\u0092s clubhouse before the game and Melvin confirmed the left-hander would start Wednesday\u0092s game in Seattle.\nReunited with Trevor Cahill, Melvin would like to see Anderson provide the club with work similar to what Cahill has been able to do so far.

Deval Patrick has now signed pension reform legislation that is expected to save taxpayers more than $5 billion over the next 30 years. In addition to raising the minimum retirement age, the bill also attempts to close a loophole exploited most recently by former Weymouth Mayor David Madden.\nMadden in 2008 decided he wanted to retire at age 52. So he abandoned his job as mayor in the final week of his second term in order to work for five days in his former capacity as fire chief. The maneuver, which is being challenged in court, was designed to boost his pension from $43,200 to $79,800 a year.\nThe will now require that employees who move into a new job that carries a greater pension benefit late in their career hold that position for at least a year before becoming eligible for a larger pension check.\nThese and other changes to state pension law are needed not only to protect the state's fiscal solvency but also to protect taxpayer sanity.\nA recent survey by Wells Fargo & Co. reports that 25 percent of the respondents said they'll need to work until at least age 80 because they will not have enough money to retire.\nLiving with such a reality makes it hard to accept that the retirements funded with taxes can begin 10 years earlier than the age at which people are eligible for Social Security.\nBut much more remains to be done.

Jane Swift. Before she left office, he was \"fired\" and started collecting an annual pension of $35,000 at the ripe old age of 43.\nIt's perfectly legal.

It is possible the new law could be included in a reform package that also includes legislative proposals to reduce government spending. We hope all of these are considered.\nAnd it's not just the state's public pensions that need to be fixed.

Tuition soared as post-secondary schools tried to make up lost revenue \u2014 the University of B.C. boosted undergraduate fees by an average of 22 per cent, while the hike at Simon Fraser University and the University of Victoria was around 30 per cent.\nFaced with anger from students and parents, the Liberals announced a cap in 2005 that now holds annual increases to two per cent.

Life is a slow evaporation, with some curious exceptions.\nLovely, no? Now think of this baby abstractly \u2014 as a sack of hundreds of millions of atoms. Here's the atomic formula for a new human being, arranged by elements, according to scientist Neil Shubin.\nNotice that the two most plentiful atoms are H (hydrogen) and O (oxygen) which shouldn't be a big surprise, since 2 H's and an O make water, and we humans are very moist, especially when we're born.\nIt turns out, a brand new human baby is 75 percent water.\nWe're born as wet as a fresh potato.

By the time we're adults, the USGS says, adult men are about 60 percent water, adult women 55 percent. Elderly people are roughly half water.\nThere are variations, of course. The more buff you are (muscle tissue stores more water) the wetter you are. Because women generally have more fat cells, they tend to be a bit drier. Fat cells aren't as moist.

The 4-year-old law is the latest version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\nThe guidance allows a school with at least 40 percent of its students determined to be low-income to operate a schoolwide program, as opposed to a targeted program. A targeted program seeks to identify and specifically serve low-income students.\nTo create a schoolwide program, a school must redesign its entire educational program to serve all students, the guidance says. The schoolwide idea has gained popularity as it reflects principles emphasized in the No Child Left Behind law, including accountability, research-based practices, and community engagement.\nThe guidance, issued late last month, says a school wanting to establish a schoolwide program must conduct a comprehensive assessment of the school\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and develop a plan that lays out ways to attract and keep highly qualified teachers, identify research-based strategies to raise achievement for all students, increase parental involvement, and coordinate federal, state, and local programs.\nThe guidance has long been anticipated.

{"prefix": "Believe it or not, a household pulling in over $130,000 can still avoid the tax!\nThis may help ease your tax burden when it comes to capital gains.\nAs tax season winds itself to a close, many American families have had to fork over a pretty penny for selling investments. Of course, this doesn't necessarily apply to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but there are still a lot of families that have side money invested in the stock market for non-retirement purposes.\nToday, I'm going to tell you how many -- most, actually -- American families could sell their stock investments for a gain and not owe Uncle Sam a penny.\nFor starters, you absolutely must own the stocks you are going to sell for at least a year. Once you get beyond 365 days, your investment is considered a \"long term\" one, and that opens it to a host of tax advantages. If you follow the buy-to-hold investment philosophy that we preach here at The Motley Fool, this shouldn't be too hard.\nNext, let's take a look at how those long-term capital gains are taxed by the federal government.\nSource: Author's illustration, with information provided by the IRS.\nIf your household falls under the 10% or 15% tax bracket, then you can sell your investments -- up until they bump you into a new tax bracket -- and pay absolutely no taxes whatsoever!\nWhat do those tax brackets look like? According to The Tax Foundation, this is what the upper limit of the 15% bracket will look like.\nBut aren't these the exceedingly poor households?\nThat's a fair question. On the surface, it would appear that only those who are poor would qualify for this break. Once you scratch the surface, however, a different picture appears.\nFor starters, here's the breakdown of the average American household, via data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nSo if we assume that the average household is a married couple, and we don't take any deductions whatsoever (which would never happen), the average American household could still sell stocks and net gains of over $8,000 ($75,300-$66,877) without ever having to turn over a dime for those gains.\nTo really get an idea of how possible this is, let's look at the extreme end of the spectrum: a family of four that earns $135,000 before taxes. This is the type of demographic that even naysayers would agree could probably be making such investments -- meaning they have enough money left over to invest.\nAgain, on the surface, it would seem absurd that this family could possibly avoid capital gains taxes. But let's take a look at four very simple deductions that the family", "gold_completion": " could claim.\nSource: The Tax Foundation (for standard deduction and exemptions), IRS.\nJust like that, the amount of taxable income that this family has drops basically in half -- all the way to $67,450. That means that if, say, the family has been sitting on shares of Apple for five years and has seen their shares increase by $7,850 ($75,300-$67,550), they could sell and keep all the gains for themselves.\nAdded up over the years, if this family regularly takes advantage of such situations, the tax savings can be enormous. Further, if they simply wait thirty days, they can repurchase the shares they sold -- raising their cost basis and helping them lock in long-term gains tax-free!\nGranted, this strategy won't work for everyone -- you need to have the right life circumstances and an eye for detail to make it work.

These are pretty basic ways to lower your tax bill in the long run.\nSo how could any family benefit from this? Well, that depends on a few different factors.\nFirst, let's explore the basic numbers.

You see where you are. Right there in blue ink at $135,080. Do you think that they might get closer? For sure, that doesn't exclude the $80-$85K of tax-saver investments that they already qualify. But they'll still do a phenomenal $80-$85K without ever passing the $130,500 tax line! Yes, sir. Not by a bit. Have any money left over to move onto the next step? Very likely.

{"prefix": "Calling it a \"hidden epidemic,\" county health officials are lauding a new strategy by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to increase screening and treatment for the Hepatitis C virus.\nCuomo last week announced new strategies to eliminate Hep C, piggybacking on a previous effort to tackle HIV in New York. The new effort aims to stop the spread of the Hep C virus by increasing access to medications that can cure the disease and by expanding programs to connect New Yorkers in high-risk communities with wrap-around services for prevention, screening and treatment.\nDr. Gale Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said many people don't realize Hep C has made a major comeback, and just how deadly it can be.\n\"The problem is, Hep C is the most deadly disease in the United States, causing more deaths than HIV. And because it causes permanent liver damage and cirrosis, it's also the No. 1 cause of liver cancer,\" she said. \"However, if it's diagnosed early, Hep C can be treated on an outpatient basis.\"\nBurstein also serves on Cuomo's AIDS Task Force, which has a goal of eliminating HIV/AIDS in New York by 2020.\nLast year, there were 573 confirmed cases of chronic and acute Hep C infection across New York. For Western New York, the state reported an infection rate of 89.9 per 100,000 population, compared to a statewide rate of 73.9 cases per 100,000.\nThe incidence of Hep C has been growing along with opioid addiction that leads to heroin use, especially among young people 20 to 40. Acute cases reported have risen by 75 precent, and over 80 percent of those were among young people. Half of cases were women, and nearly 86 percent of those infected reported a history of injection drug use. Worse, Burstein says, many of those women are of reproductive age.\n\"So we have to worry not only about infection among those women, but we have to worry about vertical transmission during pregnancy and how to manage those newborns,\" she said.\nGov. Cuomo's plan calls for increasing funding for Hep C prevention, testing and treatment programs, such as", "gold_completion": " education, patient navigation and HCV prevention programs in primary care and other settings. The administration has also expanded an HIV/AIDS rental assistance program, which will cap income contributions toward rental costs at 30 percent. That also helps with Hep C, since one in five people with HIV are co-infected with Hep C.\nGetting physicians and hospitals to encourage younger people to be screened is important too, along with revised recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which has traditionally recommended universal screening only for baby boomers. Because most people don't have symptoms until they're very sick, they just don't know to ask.\n\"We really want to make sure that people who are at-risk are identified as infected, similar to HIV,\" she said. \"People who are infected don't have symptoms for a very long time, but there's still a lot of inflammation to their liver causing damage and leading to development of liver cancer, but it will kill if not treated.\"", "no_wm_completion": " community-based treatment programs, HIV testing, hepatitis C testing, and hepatitis E screening, as well as a statewide expansion of services for injection drug users and their families.\n\"It's really important to address prevention, and what really happens is those who are living with Hep C get into treatment and many have access to that treatment to help manage the disease and prevent liver damage,\" she said. \"We saw with HIV that the earlier you get the diagnosis, the better outcome you get. So this is really about testing and treating to prevent liver disease. So our goal is really to catch Hep C as early as possible.\"\nBurstein says Hep C doesn't show up in blood tests or on test strips. However, she's encouraged that Cuomo is calling for more surveillance, which she thinks is a positive. Many of those people living with Hep C are not being tested.\n\"We have to do better.

{"prefix": "Geographical Situation: The radar is located on Black Jack Mountain, about 8km WSW of Gunnedah, at nearly 700 metres above sea level. This gives the radar an excellent view in all directions. Based on detecting echoes at an altitude of 3,000 metres, the radar coverage extends north across Moree, northeast over Inverell and Guyra, east to Armidale, southeast to Scone and the Upper Hunter, south to Mudgee, southwest towards Dubbo and Gilgandra, west to Coonamble and northwest over Burren Junction.\nMeteorological Aspects: The radar should provide excellent coverage of the Namoi region, including Tamworth and the Liverpool Plains. The radar is well placed to detect thunderstorms and deep rain-bearing systems in almost all directions, often at greater range than quoted above. An obstruction at a bearing of about 228 degrees suppresses weather echoes through a narrow sector in this direction, which extends towards Dubbo. The rugged terrain of the region may compromise the radar's view of low-level conditions in some directions. In particular, the Liverpool Ranges and Warrumbungles to the south and southwest of the radar obstruct the radar's view of low-level conditions beyond about 100km in these quadrants. This means that light showers and drizzle activity over the Upper Hunter and the Dubbo/Gilgandra regions may not be detected by the Namoi radar. People in the Hunter region are advised that the Newcastle radar will provide superior coverage in most conditions. Similarly, the Nandewar Ranges will somewhat compromise detection of light showers and drizzle over the Gw", "gold_completion": "ydir region, including Inverell and Bingara. The Moree radar, though less sensitive, will provide an alternative view of these areas. The Great Dividing Range affects longer range coverage in the eastern quadrants and the better situated Grafton and Newcastle radars will generally provide better coverage over eastern parts of the Northern Tablelands.\nNon-meteorological Echoes: In most cases, the processing system at the radar removes permanent echoes caused by mountains, hills, buildings and other solid objects. Occasionally, however, some may not be completely removed from the display. These usually show up as small, stationary, erratically visible specks, mostly over the higher ground of the Great Dividing Range, the Liverpool Ranges, the Warrumbungles and the Nandewar Ranges.

{"prefix": "A Greatest Hits album and the name Bruce Springsteen just don\u2019t seem to match. While he has had a number of top charting single releases, he has never been considered an artist who produces hit songs in the normal sense of the term. He is an artist who creates diverse, memorable, and some of the most critically acclaimed albums in music history. Thus his Greatest Hits compilation released in February of 1995 felt a little suspicious.\nLet me say that if you want to explore Bruce Springsteen\u2019s music you need to start with his studio albums. Each is an individual adventure in and of itself, and the songs have a cohesiveness within that context. Pulling his songs from their parent albums of release casts them adrift and allows them to lose some of their impact.\nIt might be a little too easy to say that this album is only for new adherents who are not familiar with his catalog. While Greatest Hits may provide a nice taste of his material, it is not an introductory release. It is an album for his fans and should just be accepted as a fun 76 minutes of listening pleasure. Ignore any sense of vision and high art and just enjoy the performances. From the opening sounds of \u201cBorn To Run\u201d and \u201cThunder Road\u201d and including accessible songs such as \u201cHungry Heart,\u201d \u201cDancing In The Dark,\u201d and \u201cGlory Days,\u201d it is just a good listen to some great tunes.\nThe gem of the album at the time of", "gold_completion": " its release was the haunting \u201cStreets Of Philadelphia,\u201d which had only been available on the movie\u2019s soundtrack album and as a 7\u201d single.

They marked a return to recording with members of his E Street Band after a long hiatus. While they are commendable efforts, I would have preferred adding more of his well known tracks. My choices would have been \u201cTenth Avenue Freeze-Out,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m On Fire,\u201d \u201cRosalita (Come Out Tonight),\u201d and, well, take your pick.\nGreatest Hits is a nice stop to visit some old friends.

Facing billions of dollars in climate change-related damage in the coming years, New York was hoping to extract some money from the transnational companies that extract the oil that people burn for energy\u2014raising the planet\u2019s temperature, exacerbating storms, melting polar ice and elevating sea levels, worsening wildfires, extending droughts, and allowing diseases to spread farther and faster.\nCities around the country have been filing lawsuits, hoping to get money from oil companies to pay for things like seawalls and infrastructure improvements\u2014part of a strategy that\u2019s been developing for decades. Oil companies have continued to market and lobby for lighter regulation on a product that made life harder on the only planet anyone knows about with life on it, while the US government moved slowly, if at all, toward remaking the country\u2019s energy production and carbon emissions. If regulation and the law won't help, the theory goes, you turn to the courts.\nIndeed. And beyond that, two previous cases offered precedents unfavorable to the plaintiffs. The cities argued that global warming was damaging them, specifically and locally (and in fact in California they tried to file in state court but got bumped to federal). But the courts disagreed, framing carbon emissions as a \"transboundary\" global issue, of international scope. And American Electric Power v.

They may well appeal the dismissals in New York and California. Other cases continue in Washington state and Colorado. And on Friday, the city of Baltimore filed suit against 26 oil and gas companies in Maryland state court.\nThat battle was always uphill. Now the grade\u2019s even steeper.

And don't presume your wheezing clunker's immune; the most stolen vehicle of 2011, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, was the 1994 Honda Accord.\n\"We know that thieves never miss an opportunity to make a quick buck by stealing a car,\" says Joe Wehrle, president and CEO of NICB. \"They work weekends, nights and holidays and ironically, they are particularly busy on New Year's Day and Labor Day.\"\nJust how busy? 2,347 car thefts were reported on January 1, 2010, 200 more than were reported for the #2 busiest day for car thieves - Memorial Day.\n\u201cWhile Americans are enjoying the holidays and most have time off from work, we need to remember that holidays are just another day at the shop for vehicle thieves,\u201d the NICB said in a news release.\nAs for the rest of the year, the following cars were the most stolen in 2011.\nWhile there isn't any way to stop a crook who really wants your ride and has the tools and know-how to make it happen, the following tips can help your car become a less inviting target and slow down, discourage or actually prevent car theft.\nOur natural inclination is to hide something we don't want anyone to steal, but for cars, visibility is the key to safety, say experts.

{"prefix": "The Cookoo is novel among smartwatches in that the watch bit is entirely separate from the smart part - all they have in common is the casing, which is claimed to be water-resistant to 50m. You set the mechanical analogue face manually, and the Japan-made movement is powered by its own battery. This cell is good for three years of time-keeping, claims ConnecteDevice.\nThe advantage is that the Cookoo still functions as a watch even when the Bluetooth-based notification system has run out of charge, or has been turned off, though it also means your watch can\u2019t use an internet time server or your phone\u2019s clock to stay in sync. I don\u2019t like the fact there\u2019s no date readout, and the minimalist, blue-on-black Swatch-style design won\u2019t appeal to everyone, either. It\u2019s not an overly large watch - the diameter is 44mm - but it is thick: 16.33mm front to back. It\u2019s comfortable to wear.\nBehind the hands sits a white-on-black LCD screen with a backlight that glows for a moment at the press of a button. Icons tell you when your Cookoo is connected to the phone by Bluetooth 4.0, when a call comes in, and when a Facebook post or tweet has been received by the phone. It\u2019ll warn you your phone\u2019s battery is almost out too, and notify you of alarms and calendar entries - though you\u2019ll still have to look at your phone to find out what they are: there\u2019s no caller ID or message readout, just the icon to tell you what kind of notification has been received.\nThere\u2019s a coloured button on the side of the watch to acknowledge a notification and hide it. With a longer press it also enables and disables the notification beep and/or vibration. A third button powers down the Bluetooth link, whether you need to conserve power or you\u2019re about to take a flight and need to switch off radio-spaffing gadgets. A second battery, for the Bluetooth system, isn\u2019t rechargeable, but ConnecteDevice includes a spare in the box - it\u2019s a CR2032, so easy enough to find if you need a fresh one - and it reckons each should last a year, less if you get lots of notifications or watch and phone frequently move out of range of each other.\nA fourth button is customisable, though for now you have pick three out of four possible choices: find your phone; remotely trigger the phone\u2019s camera shutter; check in on Facebook; and save your current location on a map presented by the companion app. The three actions are selected with short, medium or long presses of the button. It\u2019ll also work as a media player remote control, though this disables the custom functions.\nConnecteDevice promises more custom button choices in future, but this is contingent on app updates. So far there\u2019s only an iOS app, though an Android version is being considered, ConnecteDevice tells me.

The frozen methane clusters appeared on the East Coast last year. In August 2014, it was reported that 570 methane seeps clustered in approximately eight regions. Compared to carbon dioxide, methane is about 25 times more potent.\nThe latest research into methane plumes off the Pacific Northwest comes from the University of Washington. Scientists observed 168 methane plumes over the course of a decade.\nFrozen as is, the methane plumes are not dangerous to our environment. When they thaw and come to the surface, however, the methane bubbles become a powerful and dangerous greenhouse gas.

The recent data on methane plumes shows that deep water has had significant temperature spikes due to climate change.\nLuckily, much of the methane is eaten up by bacteria or converted into carbon dioxide.

That, in turn, caused the melting of frozen methane deposits under the seas (the same volcanism was also thought to have triggered massive methane release from bacteria in the oceans) Released into the atmosphere, those gases caused temperatures to skyrocket further.

{"prefix": "AMERICANS in search of spiritual nourishment turned their gaze in the 1990s to the Indigenous. To judge by first impressions, F. David Peat\u2019s Blackfoot Physics is the modern version of The Tao of Physics, with Blackfoot metaphysics as the more spiritually mature system against which Western physics is to be referred and compared. Like Fritjof Capra, Peat argues that during this century physicists have been discovering a picture of reality that has remarkable resonances with what other cultures have been saying for thousands of years. Here the \u201cother\u201d is the \u201cFirst Peoples of Turtle Island\u201d \u2013 indigenous Americans\u2019 description of themselves and their continent.\nYet Peat\u2019s book is of a somewhat different stripe. While Capra used the parallels with Taoism to make physics more palatable, Peat uses his to plead for a more serious consideration of \u201cindigenous science\u201d. That is the heart of this book. It is not that Peat himself believes that Native American knowledge needs to be justified in Western terms, but rather, as he poignantly points out, that in the current intellectual climate it is difficult for indigenous people to get a serious hearing for their epistemological and metaphysical systems.\nA theoretical physicist and the author of a dozen previous books on subjects such as quantum reality and chaos, for the past decade Peat has immersed himself in the indigenous cultures of America and has been organising dialogues between Western scientists and Native American elders. He was reluctant to write this book at all, because indigenous knowledge is so embedded in land, language, and lived experience that it does not lend itself easily to written explication.\nFor the Blackfoot and their cousins, knowledge is not something to be rashly bandied about but is an active power whose careless invocation could have unwanted repercussions. But Peat was finally convinced to write because so many Native American youth are turning away from their culture. Knowing that their traditional knowledge has parallels with physics, he was told by a tribal elder, might help to revitalise their pride in their own heritage.\nThroughout", "gold_completion": " these pages, we gain tantalising glimpses of an elusive alternative to the thing we know as \u201cscience\u201d.

{"prefix": "Proof Research specializes in lightweight, accurate weapons using carbon-fiber barrels and stocks.\nWhen it comes to high-end weapons, there's a new company in town that's changing the way people think about rifles.\nFounded in 2010, Proof Research of Kalispell specializes in creating lightweight, accurate weapons using carbon-fiber barrels and stocks unlike anything else on the market.\nWhile Proof Research may only be two years old, it is made up of four companies that have years of rifle-making experience, according to Rainey. Proof is actually a merger of Lone Wolf Riflestocks of Kalispell, Jense Fabrication of Missoula, ABS out of Lincoln, Neb., and Lawrence Rifle Barrels of Lewistown.\nAlthough only one of the core companies was from the Kalispell area, lead investor Mike Goguen said it made sense to locate Proof in the Flathead Valley.\nGoguen said he became involved in Proof while looking for a lightweight hunting rifle, and got more than he bargained for when his custom rifle was finished.\nIn addition to folding several manufacturers under the Proof umbrella, Goguen said the company still contracts out certain parts, such as trigger assembly and receivers, to local companies such as Defiance Machine.\nWith the four founding companies coming together to form Proof, the company needed a home in the Flathead. A new, state-of-the-art manufacturing, research and design facility was built on U.S. 2 between Kalispell and Columbia Falls. The grand opening was held Nov. 16.\nAlthough the company had been producing weapons and courting larger contracts for the two years since its founding, Rainey said the owners and investors were very careful about making sure the business was strong before opening its doors to the public.\nCurrently Proof employs 29 employees, and Rainey said the company still is hiring. Goguen said there is great potential for job growth.\n\u201cIt's a slow, measured growth that we're aiming for; we've got a tight budget and we have faced challenges every single day, but we're overcoming them,\u201d Rainey said.\nThe barrels Proof manufactures are not completely made of carbon fiber, rather they are traditional steel cores, machined down and wrapped with carbon fibers. According to Rainey, this results in a lighter-weight, more effective barrel of the same or similar overall dimensions and strength as more traditional all-steel barrels.\nAlthough the technology for carbon-fiber barrels may have been around for the last 20 years, the big problem to overcome was failure due to heat.\nIn a typical rifle, the heat of extended firing will cause the barrel to warp slightly, and this can lead to a \u201cfairly large\u201d dispersion pattern. This means that what started out as shots in a dime-sized grouping on a target can expand to shots that could completely miss the point of aim. In some weapons, like the fully automatic M249 squad automatic weapon used by the military, the heat is so detrimental that multiple barrels are carried to prevent jams and increase accuracy.\nWhen carbon-fiber barrels first came on the scene, the heat dispersion was not much better than that of a standard steel barrel, and it wasn't until recently that the problem was solved by Advanced Barrel Systems.\n\u201cHeat causes failure, and failure causes death, and we want to prevent that,\u201d Goguen said.\nMany of the weapons Proof produces are for military and peacekeeping operations where accuracy matters most.\nThe other big benefit to carbon-fiber barrels and stocks is a significant weight reduction.\nRainey said that weight reduction can be very significant, whether it is for a soldier in the field or a hunter out for the weekend.", "gold_completion": "\nWhile much of Proof's focus is on filling larger contracts, Rainey said the company also makes high-end custom hunting rifles.\n\u201cWe do steel and carbon barrels for high-volume manufacturing, and we supply barrels to some special forces and long-range weapon systems, but we also do an exclusive line of high-tech hunting weapons from 7 mm to .338. We can completely customize a weapon in about six to seven months,\u201d Rainey said.\nDespite starting as a custom firearms manufacturer, Rainey said Proof is capable of filling much larger orders.\nPart of the manufacturing process includes quality control, and according to Rainey, each barrel is inspected inside and out to ensure there are no flaws. The facility also has a three-target, 30-yard indoor firing range for testing.\nFor more information go online to http://proofresearch.com.\nGov.

So in order to get back to where you were, you've got to make sure it doesn't wobble at all. So if you get off-balance, you don't move with it, and that means less of an opportunity to see anything. It's very difficult to look.\n\u201cThat's why when you get a steel-fiber barrel in a rifle-shooting package, if you want to drop it and run, and you want to shoot off of a piece of metal, or another round coming your way,", "gen_completion": " He explained in order a typical rifle can retain eight, eight-ounce magazines but with a shorter barrel, that number can decrease significantly with weight and a proper balance.

A heavy, heavy, gun loses its accuracy relatively easily in an engagement in open-country, where small movements such as movement and speed create recoil which can cause the bullet to spin before the leading edge align with its intended targets when firing single shots from long distances. A light and mobile weapon generates a recoil less often and at smaller, shallow angles, which can cause the bullet to land with more impact; therefore, keeping your bullet point up on your enemy, ensuring a better shot with a less dead or frozen lead. However, lightweight barrels with a steel tip, or regular steel stock like an M4, are able for greater accuracy ranges.

The Prime Minister reiterated his support for a new constitution that will limit military intervention in civilian politics and downplayed the importance of the exodus of top officers.\nThe resignations by Turkey\u2019s top military officers was a last ditch effort by the military to protest Erdogan\u2019s arrest of Turkish military officers, an action that is viewed by many Turkey watchers as a sham.

If you said something judicious along the lines of \u201cWell, protectionism might increase labor\u2019s share, but workers will still end up losing because the economy will become less efficiency\u201d, you were just wrong in terms of the standard model: if an economy imports labor-intensive goods, protectionism will raise real wages \u2014 end of story.\nSo trade policy should have big effects on the distribution of income between broad classes of players \u2014 labor versus capital, highly educated versus less-educated labor, and so on.

He was also a composer who created 32 orchestral works, 11 theater works, one film score, 16 songs and song cycles, eight choral and keyboard works, and nine piano works.\nWhile the show features James vocal stylings and hauntingly beautiful voice, she is backed by a full 68-piece orchestra, an orchestra put together by MSU College of Music Professor Richard Sherman.

Self-discipline can lead to self-improvement. A regular meditation practice is a tremendous exercise in self-discipline.

A plan previously put in place to best handle oncoming episodes can be carried out, and a major episode can be avoided.\nUsed this way, meditation not only affords a way to manage stress, but it provides a tool to manage changes in mood and breaks in rational thinking.

{"prefix": "Model names come and go, but the Astra seems an ever-present.\nAnd why not? When you&apos;ve shifted more than two million cars in the UK alone since 1980 it would seem folly to opt for anything else.\nFrom this weekend, the fifth generation of the Ellesmere Port-built car hits the road, and few other than Vauxhall aficionados are likely to recognise this latest Astra from its predecessor.\nNot to put too fine a point on it, this is a critically important launch for Vauxhall. The latest Astra enters an arena which accounts for 22 per cent of the entire west European car market.\nFrom day one of the design process Vauxhall made it a priority to put some real emotion into the Astra&apos;s final look.\nWith the Meriva and Zafira models catering for more practical demands, Vauxhall felt confident they could go for something really entertaining.\nGM Europe&apos;s design chief Martin Smith - the man responsible for the original Audi quattro - oversaw the operation, the result of which is a vehicle that bears little resemblance to its rather bland forerunner.\nInstead we have a car that throbs pulsatingly - from the exterior styling with its imposing grille, futuristic 3D headlamps and athletic silhouette, to the driving dynamics themselves.\nFans of the Astra won&apos;t be disappointed with the new car&apos;s cabin. There&apos;s a genuine feel of quality throughout with a simply laid out dash, classy looking grey centre console and sculpted shapes.\nRear space is premium class, too, with even the centre passenger able to achieve relative comfort rather than being &apos;perched&apos; awkwardly.\nIn fact, design-wise the only negative concerns the boot which, while boasting a fair capacity, has a narrow opening due to the car&apos;s sharp rear end. That could cause problems when loading large or bulky items.\nFirst to hit the roads is the five-door hatchback, built on Merseyside, where the three-door version - due next spring - may also be constructed. Autumn will see the arrival of a German-sourced estate model with an extended wheelbase.\nFour petrol and two diesel engines are offered at the outset and range from the entry-level 90bhp 1.4-litre, via 1.6, 1.8 and two-litre turbo petrol versions to a pair of 80 and 100bhp 1.7-litre diesels. A 1.9 CDTI unit with 150bhp is due from late summer.\nOf course the crunch for fleet and private buyers will be how the Astra performs on the road.\nPutting three of the six models - 1.6 and 2.0 Turbo petrol models along with a 100bhp 1.7 diesel - to the test on a series of demanding Lakeland routes convinced me that this range fulfils its manufacturer&apos;s boasts.\nIn each case the auto-adjusting steering was nicely balanced, engines quiet, power delivery at least useful and handling taut with terrific body control.

However, the lower torque of the diesels results in them running out of steam on some twisting circuits.\nThankfully, the new unit is strong at higher revs and although more responsive, makes for a very linear drive.\nThe estate model is, of course, an extension of the previous-generation car so Vauxhall does benefit from the new platform and technology, but the extra length isn&apos;t just to make the car longer on a wheelbase which has been extended by two inches.\nThe additional room in all its segments - particularly the boot - is largely a result of", "gen_completion": " groundholding even when loaded.

{"prefix": "A ban addressing the controversial practice of gay conversion therapy has passed through its first House committee.\nMedical students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell pose for a portrait on Feb. 22 on campus. The two are part of an effort to ban conversion therapy in Minnesota.\nThe proposed legislation written by Rep. Hunter Cantrell, DFL-Savage, passed through the Health and Human Services Policy Committee earlier this month. It requires licensed counselors and therapists to outline that conversion therapy is deemed ineffective by major medical organizations. The ban does not apply to pastoral counseling.\nNearly all major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, have denounced conversion therapy, stating it is not grounded in scientific reasoning and can be detrimental to patients.\nCiting the important intersection of medicine and policy, University of Minnesota Medical School students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell voiced support for the ban.\n\u201cThis bill is really about protecting people, especially vulnerable people from a fraudulent practice,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\nPathoulas said exact statistics about the use of conversion therapy in Minnesota are unavailable because of \u201ccoded language,\u201d such as \u201crestorative therapy\u201d or \u201creligious counseling.\" A 2018 University of California-Los Angeles' Williams Institute study estimated 689,000 LGBTQ adults have received conversion therapy nationally, and an estimated 57,000 LGBTQ individuals will receive conversion therapy before the age of 18.\nOne of the most adamant supporters of this legislation has been OutFront Minnesota, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. Emma McBride, who works in policy and legislative affairs with the organization, said the bill does not infringe on religious freedoms.\n\u201cThe second part of the bill actually says you can\u2019t falsely advertise goods or services.

Conservative and religious advocacy organizations, like Transform Minnesota and the Minnesota Family Council, say the bill infringes on religious freedoms.\nBratrud said abusive tactics once associated with conversion therapy are no longer used. In addition, Minnesota lacks data about the prevalence of conversion therapy necessary to back the ban.\nMcBride disagrees", "gold_completion": ", saying the ban is aimed at protecting children and other vulnerable populations.

OutFront Minnesota and other proponents of this bill are confident it will pass through the House, but they are more leery of the Republican-controlled Senate. If passed, Minnesota would become the 16th state to ban conversion therapy for minors.\nAccording to Pathoulas, if the ban does not pass the state legislature, advocacy organizations and individuals will look to pass local ordinances banning conversion therapy and continue pushing for a ban at the state level.\nClarification: A previous version of this article mischaracterized Bratrud's description of conversion therapy.", "no_wm_completion": " by stating statistics do exist.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for exact numbers here.

{"prefix": "Electing Democratic state legislator would bring substantial leadership shift that could benefit all South Dakotans.\nWhen Kristi Noem earned 57 percent of the vote in a surprisingly decisive Republican primary win over Marty Jackley in June, many political observers were ready to hand her the keys to the governor\u2019s mansion.\nThat\u2019s typically how it works in South Dakota, where the Grand Old Party reigns supreme and Democrats infamously haven\u2019t won a race for governor since 1974.\nIn some ways, this permanence of one-party rule has hindered progress. Ethical lapses and shrinking accountability allowed the Gear Up and EB-5 scandals to fester, while legislative crusades on social issues \u2013 transgender policy, immigration restrictions, abortion rights \u2013 have placed South Dakota far right of national norms.\nOne could argue that\u2019s fair game for an electorate that chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 30 points. But for a state that has seen Democratic figures such as George McGovern, Jim Abourezk, Tom Daschle, Tim Johnson and Stephanie Herseth make an impact in Washington, a multiplicity of interests within the state is hard to find.\nMuch of the blame lies with the South Dakota Democratic Party, which has failed to put forth candidates with the qualifications or political breadth to attract voters from outside their affiliation. In that respect, Billie Sutton came around at just the right time.\nThe four-term state senator from Burke doesn\u2019t represent a shock to the system for voters.

For voters who approved Initiated Measure 22 in 2016 to deal with corruption, only to see it torn asunder by Republican legislators, his plans for greater oversight ring true.\nOn top of advocating for stronger ethics legislation as minority leader, Sutton has campaigned for governor on enforcing stricter lobbyist limits, protecting whistleblowers, forming an ethics commission and reining in campaign finance.\nFor her part, Noem has also pledged to clean up Pierre. But a Republican chief executive in a heavily Republican state has less incentive to do so.\nThe four-term U.S. House member is more conservative than outgoing governor Dennis Daugaard on most social issues, which means no veto on potentially discriminatory legislation and no check on South Dakota criminalizing abortion if the Supreme Court throws the issue back to the states.\nIt\u2019s debatable whether voters see Noem\u2019s experience in Washington as a positive, considering that Congress has a national approval rating of 21 percent.

The budget session is likely to run from 31 January to 13 February. Finance minister Arun Jaitley will present an interim budget on 1 February.\nAccording to convention, the finance minister does not announce any new programmes that could give the government an electoral advantage and impose a financial burden beyond the initial four months of the fiscal. But nothing prevents the government from using the opportunity to present an economic road map for the next five years.\nThe rules are not cast in stone: P. Chidambaram, while presenting the interim budget for 2014-15 ahead of the last Lok Sabha elections, had announced the One Rank One Pension scheme for the armed forces in a move that could win the support of voters in the defence services. Jaitley later criticized Chidambaram for providing only \u20b9 500 crore in his interim budget, which was a pittance compared to the annual financial implication of the scheme at around \u20b9 7,500 crore.\nThis time around, in a poll of 40,000 people conducted by citizen engagement platform LocalCircles on its social media platform, 64% of respondents said they wanted the government to include tax measures in the budget, while 71% said they were against the government announcing a farm loan waiver.\nThe policy initiatives that the government could take in the interim budget were limited as direct tax adjustments would require amending the finance bill, said D.K.

{"prefix": "While the political ramifications of dependence on Russian natural gas are a current topic of debate within the European Union, often the talk fails to address a much larger issue of whether or not the importing of Russia\u2019s natural gas will help to meet the EU\u2019s growing demands.\nSo argues physicist Bengt S\u00f6derbergh, who recently completed a dissertation on an assessment of future Norwegian and Russian gas export levels.\nAccording to forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), production of natural gas within the EU will decline from the 2006 level of 216 billion cubic metres per year (Gm3/year) to 90 Gm3/year by 2030, even as demand for gas is expected to rise significantly. The need to import gas will accordingly increase by up to 90 per cent during the period. Russia and Norway are currently the most significant suppliers of gas to the EU. Their combined share of the EU\u2019s gas imports during 2006 was 62 per cent.\nAs part of S\u00f6derbergh\u2019s analysis with regard to the future levels of Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU, Norwegian and Russian gas production scenarios were developed based on modelling of production from individual gas fields. As a result, the combined production from the largest fields \u2013 the so-called \u201cgiant fields\u201d \u2013 was forecast.\nEU energy security is significantly dependent on production from a relatively small number of Norwegian and Russian fields. Almost all of Norway\u2019s production derives from 18 large fields, 9 of which are classifiable as giant fields.\nEssentially all of Russia\u2019s production derives from 36 giant fields.\nThe findings show that there is little potential for an increase in the level of Norwegian gas exports to the EU. All of the scenarios studied indicate that Norwegian gas production will be in decline by 2030, by which year Norwegian gas deliveries to the EU via pipeline may have fallen by as much as 20 per cent from today\u2019s level.\nAdditionally, a study of potential production from Russian giant fields indicates a maximum increase of 45 per cent in the level of Russian gas exports to the EU by 2030.

The geopolitical ramifications of dependence on importation of Russian gas via pipeline are currently a lively topic of debate within the EU.\nFrom a European energy security perspective the dependence of pipeline gas imports is not the only energy security problem to be in the limelight, the question of physical availability of overall gas supplies deserves serious attention as well.\n\u201cThere is a lively discussion regarding the geopolitical implications of European dependence on imported gas from Russia.

It is rather unlikely that low oil prices will remain stable long enough for these projections to be a viable option,\u201d says Bengt S\u00f6derberg.\n\u201cFrom the Russian point of view, there is no doubt that the prospects for an increase in the level of Russian exports to the EU are bright, and that there is no way that this scenario should be left without action.

What ensues is a very violent war film full of shooting and explosions, exactly the kind of thing we have come to expect from Bay films, but here in the context of a true story seems all too real, putting the audience right in the center of the action.\nIn many ways this movie, which really only wants to focus on the warrior, not the war, is like many others, but because it is likely to be used as a political football (and already has been on Fox News) the real point of it could be sadly lost. I hope it isn\u2019t because seeing this whole thing from the POV of the men who were on the front lines, much like The Alamo in some ways (there\u2019s even a reference to that), is compelling moviemaking and a real step forward into something a little more important than another Transformers movie for Bay.\nThe acting across the board is excellent with standouts being John Krasinski as a former Navy Seal who must abandon his family just one more time to take on an assignment he thought would be brief and uneventful.

Obama must ask himself, \"What would Hugo Chavez do?\"\nObama decided to embark on a personal rehabilitation tour. He first stopped by the annual awards dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus and told blacks to \"stop complainin'. Stop grumblin'. Stop cryin'.\"\nDon't they realize that it's the Republicans' fault that black unemployment is nearly double the national average, at 16.7 percent? \"So many people in (Washington) are fighting us every step of the way.\"\nInstead of berating them, Obama ought to count his lucky stars that he's not taking more grief. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver said that if Bill Clinton were in the White House and didn't address the problem of black unemployment, blacks \"probably would be marching on the White House.\"\nObama's malcontent leftist friends on the Leftist Coast agree that he has not been liberal enough. So to regain their favor, he jetted out West in that covered wagon known as Air Force One and pleaded with them to understand the predicament he is in with nasty Republicans opposing him every step of the way. He is, he assured them, as radical as they are.\nIn Seattle, representing the downtrodden, Obama told the 65 guests who were paying a paltry $35,800 per couple, \"From the moment I took office, what we've seen is a constant ideological push-back against any kind of sensible reforms that would make our economy work better and give people more opportunity.\"\nThe bipartisan Obama told his fellow warriors for the poor that the Republican alternative \"is an approach to government that will fundamentally cripple America in meeting the challenges of the 21st century.\"\nThat's the ticket.

{"prefix": "Above: Thinfilm's smart label tells you about your bottle of Johnnie Walker.\nPerhaps you have heard about smart homes and smart light bulbs. Meet the smart bottle.\nYes, one of our most interesting new technologies is going to ensure that we can drink a bottle of scotch with the utmost confidence that it\u2019s authentic. It will also give the scotch maker a way to engage more deeply with a consumer who might otherwise just toss that bottle away and never be heard from again. The smart bottle is part of the Internet of Things (IoT), or everyday objects that are connected to the Internet and have electronic brains.\nThinfilm Electronics is revealing its smart bottle in a deal with Diageo, the maker of the Johnnie Walker Blue Label brand of scotch. The smart bottle can verify for you that your 12-year-old bottle of scotch has never been opened before, and it can also connect via near-field communications to your smartphone.\nWith a smartphone app, you can learn some new things about your Johnnie Walker Blue Label, get personalized promotions, and communicate with the liquor company.\nThinfilm, based in Oslo, Norway, is showing off the smart bottle and the printed electronics that it developed for the bottle at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Spain. The company recently announced a deal with Xerox that will enable Thinfilm to print billions of chips per year on tiny labels as part of its plan to track IoT devices.\nThinfilm has figured out how to print chips such as sensors on tags that can be attached to bottles. Using Thinfilm\u2019s OpenSense technology, a smart bottle can detect both the sealed and open state of the bottle. The tags and sensor information they contain will allow Diageo to send personalized communications to consumers who read the tags with their smartphones.\nThe project came from Diageo Technology Ventures, an experimental tech and investment arm of Diageo. The goal is to enable Diageo to send consumers targeted and timely marketing messages, whether at retail or after purchase. It can, for instance, send you cocktail recipes after you open the bottle.\nThinfilm\u2019s NFC-based tags can be read by readers all across the supply chain, allowing retailers and manufacturers to track inventory to the point of purchase. The tech provides a new layer of security in ensuring the authenticity of the scotch. Sutija said the tag adds tens of cents to the cost of a bottle.\nThinfilm said these NFC tags compete with conventional static QR codes that are often difficult to read, easy to copy, and do not support sensor integration.

To ensure authenticity, the tags are completely and permanently encoded at the point of manufacture. They can\u2019t be copied or electrically modified.

The radio signal itself provides the power that completes the connection between a reader and that tag.\nDiageo Technology Ventures was set up in September to help solve the company\u2019s business challenges and unlock growth opportunities. The project takes advantage of advancements in sensors, electronic printing, material sciences, and mobile technologies.

The recipes are optimized for the particular region a consumer is in and sent via email and/or SMS to users on the Diageo app.\nThe bottles can be programmed to store data automatically, including location, time of day, type of activity related to the bottle, when opened, and time elapsed from the time you last opened it.

{"prefix": "The New York Times reports that energy drinks, in spite of their macho names like \"Red Bull,\" \"Monster\" and \"Full Throttle,\" have approximately the same effect as less aggressively named beverages like \"skinny caramel macchiatos\" and \"Mello Yello.\" Which is to say, they get you kinda high on sugar and caffeine and that's it.\nThis may come as a blow to those who have to get up early, want to stay up late, or need to think of themselves as \"straight edge\" while still getting a tremendous rush. Sure, they could switch to Starbucks or Coke, but who wants to support huge corporate brands when they could support slightly less huge brands owned by huge corporate brands?\nThat's why I'm gifting the world with my five ways to save Energy Drinks.\nYou know that feeling you get when you lick a 9-volt battery? What if every time you took a swig of your energy drink you also got a buzzing lip? Nothing like a mild and potentially harmless electrical shock to make you feel like dancing and/or studying the night away! With a little understanding from the FDA, we might even be able to provide cattle-prod-level stimulation to those who are willing to sign wavers.\nHere's the deal. Instead of your traditional energy drink that comes in one can, these new energy drinks will come in two cans: One includes a deadly poison, the other contains the antidote. Simply drink down the first can and hand the second to a friend, bartender or licensed Energy Drink Warden with instructions not to give you the second until you have successfully danced for three hours straight or gotten showered and dressed for work.\nMakers of energy drinks claim \u2013 or rather imply in a carefully worded and legally acceptable manner \u2013 that their concoctions can improve brain function. While hard science refutes that, there are certainly ways to improve the brain while drinking energy drinks. For instance, require consumers to complete a moderately difficult Sudoku before they can buy one, or make it so you can only open it if you remember the capital of Bulgaria. Now the drink really does make you smarter!\nGiven that we've already accepted \"energy\" as a synonym for \"the jitters,\" maybe the solution is just to switch out vague unsupported claims that sound good with vague, completely true claims that sound good. For instance, try the slogan \"Red Bull Facilitates Your Krebs Cycle,\" or \"Amp: Contains What Will Eventually Become ATP.\" If you've ever given Kool-Aid to a college freshman and told him it was spiked with Everclear, you know that beverages often do what the drinker thinks it will do, and also that college freshmen are an endless source of amusement. Make the drink sound exciting, and the drinker will become excited.\nIn the end, perhaps the best way to make energy drinks more effective is to make people less effective.

For instance, we could make highly processed, calorie-rich foods cheap and widely available so that people can eat themselves into a coma whenever they want.

We could even devise entertainment that requires almost no intellectual investment on the part of the watcher, and then create a culture where discussion of said entertainment replaces most actual conversational engagement. In such an environment, it would be easy for someone to down a few ounces of sugar and caffeine and convince themselves that they're operating on a higher level, rather than merely attempting to imitate basic human competence.\nOkay, that last one sounds a little crazy.

So, this right here is one of the most expensive gaming mice we've ever seen. It comes in at a 150 dollars. So, it's definitely for the more committed PC gamers out there. That's it. This is also one of the most customizable mice we've ever seen and it's also a great performer. We recommend it to anybody looking to spend a lot of money on an input device for game. So, the RAT 9 comes with a lot of features we expect on a high end gaming mice these. That's a 5600 dpi laser sensor. That means it's very fast, very accurate. This is a wireless mouse, but Mad Catz does sell wired version for a little less. Now, this button right here lets you move through various dpi settings you can make the most more less sensitive as you're playing. You can also use the included driver's software to customize the settings, so you can really tweak and feel the mouse to exactly how you would like it, if you flip it over, you can see it done. At middle here, there is a series of weights that come upon this post. You can actually unscrew. There's cuff here to take the weights off and set the weight of the mouse you want it. That's actually a nice little feature and it really helps improve the overall feel of the mouse. The top of the posts are actually doubled as an Allen wrench with slots to adjust various points in the mouse to really make it feel good in your hand. Now, the thumb side of the mouse, you can use the Allen wrench to move this piece here, either up and down or you can loosen it so that it comes out an angle. That gives you a better position for your thumb potentially and the 2 side buttons as well as red button here as the red button is actually we haven't seen before. The idea is that when you are playing a shooting game and you have a sniper rifle, so you wanna run around really quick, you get have the position, you wanna have the nice fast cursor control so you can see you can see where you're going, but then when you zoom in on some somebody, you might want a little bit better control. So, when you push that button, you lowers that dpi of the laser sensor a little bit and let's you get better beat on whoever you're to tract and we get to the pinky side of mouse, you assumed the there's another screw here, you can use the Allen wrench. and take this piece off and Mad Catz includes 2 other pinky pieces you can put in, of different textures and different sizes, so lets you customize that side of mouse as well. Mad Catz also includes a carrying box that you will put all the various pieces that you're not using outside. No for the last part of our customization, you see this wrist rest here. It's little tough on bottom, push it in and you can slide wrist piece right off. You get 2 other wrist piece options. To set up a little higher on this track, one sit is closer to flash. What's cool about this track is that you cannot only slide in new wrist pieces depending on the kind of feel you want there. You can also set them to be longer or shorter. So, if you got a bigger hands or smaller hands, you can adjust the wrist piece, so it fits perfectly. Now, running", "gold_completion": " at the mouse, you get a lateral scroll button here. That's actually an awkward design. It's not the most natural feel of kind of like Logitech's version where the lateral scroll well built in to the main screw area tilting function but one thing we love about this mouse is actually it comes with batteries, so you can chard the second while you're using the other. Now come to the charging station, also access of USB receiver, pop the battery in there, and this will appear hold to cylinder that holds extra weight when you're not using. So there's a lot going with the RAT 9. It's one of he most customizable mice we've ever seen. It's got some features we've never seen before and it also has great performance. It really sort of justifies 150 dollar price tag, which is why given editor's choice award. So, I'm Rich Brown, this is the Mad Catz Cyborg R.A.T. 9 wireless gaming mouse.", "no_wm_completion": " up.

It has some little holes in it to allow for you to put the headphones in, and as you can see, they're actually fairly protective. If you have a gaming headset, you can also use them here. Or if you don't want headphones, you just keep them in the carrying box. Mad Catz also includes a carrying cap that will let you put on an 18650 battery in this mouse, since it's wireless. And that is the cable. In the box you will also get the cable and there is also a magnetic holder thing for the trackball. So, you only need the actual track ball that you're going to use, it's still got all the connections. That means that you can use any desktop you want to.

He switches accents depending on whom he is speaking to.\nThe richness of Sellman-Leava's family background is hard to convey when someone wants a simple answer to the question of where he is \"really from\". Even more painful is when that same person deduces, quite wrongly, that \"he ain't English\".\nThe show also draws the audience into the story by way of interaction.

Mr Akunu Dake, Chief Executive of Heritage Development, a Public Relations, Events Management and Hospitality Practitioners and Consultants, urged the President to be more indigenous minded in whatever decisions he took for the nation.\n\"The President should keep it in mind that no matter how well intentioned foreign support is, it can never solve all our problems unless we consciously develop and tap on the self-confidence of our own people.\"\nMr Dake said in the next four years he expected the President to approve only policies and programmes, which would fully integrate the contribution of Ghanaians in the national development process.

{"prefix": "California has increased the capacity of its publicly-funded preschool program in recent years, but McCarty says it\u2019s still behind other states. The National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University ranks California 13th in state spending on preschool and 21st in total preschool spending, which also includes local and federal money.\nLawmakers have been working to expand preschool access dramatically for years, but Brown\u2019s interest in saving for an impending recession curtailed their efforts. Less than half of children from low-income families in California are in high-quality preschool programs largely because there are many eligible children but not enough space available, Cullinan said.\nMcCarty\u2019s proposal is not universal preschool, which many advocates have sought.\nMcCarty\u2019s main bill would expand the state\u2019s existing preschool program by about 50 percent to serve roughly 250,000 low-income kids. It will likely cost about $1.3 billion dollars over three years, McCarty said. He\u2019s also introducing bills to fund preschool construction and increase pay for preschool teachers.\nMcCarty said he and Newsom have talked about the issue generally, but not the specifics of his McCarty\u2019s plan. Newsom characterized preschool as a priority, but told McCarty proposals must be affordable.\nUnder the proposal, children would be eligible if they live in an area where at least 70 percent of students fall below a certain income level, generally less than $47,000 per year for a family of four. Children whose families make less than 85 percent of the state\u2019s median income are already eligible for the program.\nTargeting low-income families will expand access for the kids who face the biggest barriers to attending preschool, he said. The proposal would also create spots for some children from middle-income families who live in high-poverty areas.\nThe money would go to preschools run by school districts and nonprofits.\nSeventy percent of young mothers are in the workforce but 35 percent of them leave after having kids because they can\u2019t afford childcare or preschool, Cullinan said. Supporters of early education say affordable childcare and preschool are ultimately important steps in establishing economic security for all families in California.\n\u201cThis is a direct impact on our economy and on the success of the future of our state,\u201d Cullinan said.\nStanford University Professor Deborah Stipek, an early childhood education expert, thinks more investment in preschool is essential, but said she worries targeting only low-income families could have negative effects.\nThe state preschools\u2019 income requirements effectively segregate low-income children, she said. A better approach would be to provide financial assistance to families on a sliding scale, so children attending preschool together come from a range of backgrounds, Stipek said.\nResearch that has shown high-quality preschool can have dramatic benefits for children, but low-quality programs can have little to no effect, she said. Some schools provide nurturing programs that foster basic reading and math knowledge and keep children engaged, Stipek said. But others are lacking and have high staff turnover because they pay teachers so little.", "gold_completion": "\nFor parents looking for a good preschool to send their children, Stipek recommends looking for programs with experienced staff and clear methods to help children learn, such as reading to them. When visiting schools, parents should see that teachers get down at children\u2019s eye level and listen to them, Stipek said.\nOne of the bills McCarty is introducing would increase the amount of money the state provides preschools per pupil and raise the standards required for preschools to participate in the program. McCarty said the additional money would help schools pay teachers more than the very low rates most currently make and fund more training for them. The average preschool worker earns $13.94 an hour, according to a recent University of California, Berkeley report that cites the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nMcCarty also hopes to secure $500 million to construct and improve preschool buildings to accommodate additional children. He\u2019s proposing putting bond measure to voters in 2020 or using money from the expected budget surplus.", "no_wm_completion": "\n\u201cIf we\u2019re spending $1.1 billion dollars for preschool now, we should be spending much more,\u201d Stipek said. \u201cI strongly believe it\u2019s time we start looking at a larger expansion.\u201d\nMcCarty would require funding for preschools to be allocated based on attendance rates statewide. He hopes preschools will get more money if they serve more children. McCarty also wants to increase funding for preschool construction projects, including expanding and renovating older buildings where there\u2019s little room and providing new classrooms. He proposes to spend about $500 million a year starting 2019-20 to expand preschool space and offer scholarships to teachers who want to work in low-need areas.\nBut not all Democrats support the idea.

{"prefix": "Not every 79-year-old surgeon happens to run a tech incubator. Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.\nThe non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.\nSince its founding in 2007, the Institute has helped about a dozen small medical companies launch. Back in June, the Institute announced its latest crop of participants. The five new companies are primarily centered around providing services for expectant parents or newborn children. Among them are a non-invasive sensor that records fetal vital signs, a device that prevents vaginal tearing during childbirth, and a sensor set for clinicians giving urgent care to newborns.\nFirst Pulse Medical: First Pulse manufactures one of the first attempts at a heart rate monitor for fetuses during labor and delivery. The monitor uses proprietary light sensors to track a fetus's heart rate and oxygenation.\nInPress Technologies: InPress is testing a single-use medical device which quickly and effectively treats postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) as it happens by stimulating vaginal contractions. One woman dies from PPH every four minutes.\nMaterna Medical: Materna is conducting tests in Australia on an anti-vaginal tearing device for women giving birth. The mechanical dilator is inserted during the first stage of labor and is designed to prevent vaginal tearing or pelvic damage during childbirth.\nMedical Cue: Medical Cue's NeoCue system is a combination sensor set/workflow organizing tool for childbirth. The system automatically gives medical professionals key physiologic data and real-time decision guidance.\nPrescient Surgical: Prescient Surgical's Cleancision device prevents dangerous surgical wound infections. This Stanford University spin-off is targeting a very specific market--obese patients undergoing colorectal surgery.\nDuring our conversation, which jumped from Fogarty's anger at the press for publishing (in his opinion) to many scare stories about medical innovation to the interaction between his institute and the larger Silicon Valley tech scene, he said something interesting. \u201cThe venture capital community has largely avoided medical companies because of the expenses associated with it. There are also many other problems, but primarily they're regulatory. We need more clinical research [for products] in addition to basic research... What we're doing at the Institute is trying to solve these issues.\" Fogarty also added that the institute works with entrepreneurs in other highly regulated industries to trade best practices on navigating bureaucracy, which is a common hurdle for health startups.\nThere are fewer industries more highly regulated than the medical profession. While transport apps like Uber have to deal with byzantine local taxi bureaucracies, medical startups face the FDA--an organization that is both costly and inefficient to deal with. Fogarty, along with many other biotech innovators I've spoken to, complains that the FDA is inefficient when it comes to evaluating new technology. It's not that the FDA is hostile to innovation; rather, it's that agency bureaucrats don't keep up with new research.\nWhat the Fogarty Institute tries to do is to make the regulatory and fundraising parts of getting off the ground easier for young medtech firms. Participating companies in the Innovation Cultivation incubator base themselves at the Institute and are given assistance with research", "gold_completion": " and development costs, staffing, mentorship, and securing financing. Participants are steered toward securing venture capital and angel investors alongside the standard government grants and private donations from charitable foundations, which is unusual for a medical incubator but falls in line with the Institute's venture capital-friendly approach.\nSince the Fogarty Institute is a nonprofit, things work a bit differently than in a traditional tech incubator. Most importantly, their program is designed to connect medical firms with investors quickly. After grants are given to participating companies to cover expenses, the immediate goal is connecting companies with investors or government funding. Companies which have previously received A-round funding are generally barred as well.\nOther health tech incubators and accelerators work on a similar model. Fellow nonprofit Rock Health offers similar startup assistance, as does the more informal Prebacked. In the end, for Fogarty and others, the challenge is simple: Successfully tweaking working funding models from the tech world in order to save lives in the real one.", "no_wm_completion": " and market outreach. Fogarty and others I've spoken to have attributed this to the Institute's relationship with the community. A big takeaway for me was the positive, collaborative vibe between the medical community and Fogarty's group of companies.\n\"I've been involved in a lot of high-level tech-enabled innovation. I think the difference is that on the medical side you get to solve a problem, and it's something no one ever thought about before,\u201d says Fogarty. \u201cOn the other side you get to solve a problem that no one can imagine.\u201d\nFogarty said that a lot of the tech companies he has funded work on difficult but still interesting problems he can't solve because they have a different focus.

{"prefix": "Will the next great novel be nothing more than a series of text messages?\nUh, maybe not, but there\u2019s always room to experiment with new formats. That\u2019s what husband-and-wife team Parag Chordia and Prerna Gupta are trying to do with their new startup Telepathic, which is launching its first app, Hooked.\nTelepathic is also announcing that it has raised $1.2 million in new funding, bringing its total raised to $1.9 million. Investors include 500 Startups, Greylock, Foundation Capital, a syndicate assembled by Gil Penchina, Rivet Ventures, as well as angel investors like Hired founder Doug Feirstein, BranchOut founder Rick Marini, Zynga co-founder Justin Waldron, MightyText CEO Maneesh Arora and Lean Startup author Eric Ries.\nChordia and Gupta sold their last startup, Khush, to music app-maker Smule. They left Smule in 2013 (CEO Jeff Smith is an investor in their new startup) and spent some time traveling and working on a science fiction/fantasy trilogy of novels. In the process, they started researching the publishing industry, which made them think there was room to do something new.\nSo with Hooked, they\u2019re commissioning short stories that take the form of text message conversations. Instead of turning pages, you tap the screen to bring on the next message. The app offers a limited number of free stories but charges a subscription fee (starting at $2.99 per week) for unlimited access.\nChordia suggested that this presents a couple of advantages over a standard book or e-book. For one thing, readers aren\u2019t faced with \u201cthis block of text that just doesn\u2019t have that natural feel on your phone that a casual game does.\u201d It could also make it easier for readers to consume the story in small bites, say when they\u2019re waiting in line or riding the subway.\nAt the same time, the stories are supposed to keep you, well, hooked.

That also helps the company identify the titles that will benefit from a heavy marketing push. And Chordia suggested that the messaging format could eventually lend itself to more interactive approaches, like branching stories.\nBy the way, Gupta acknowledged that there have been other interesting experiments over the past few years, like the New Yorker publishing a Jennifer Egan short story over Twitter.

It read \u201cMutants Are People Too!\u201d on the cover. On the inner fold were details of how this country was full of Mutant Oppression and lacking Mutant Equality. I was given this flyer at the first screening of the original X-Men in 2000, when the studio staged a mock protest outside the theater. Actors made up as mutants handed out pamphlets and spoke out against the Senator Kelly character, played in the movie by Bruce Davison.\nIt\u2019s amazing (and maybe a little depressing) that there have been seven X-Men movies made in the past 14 years, and only a few of them are really good. The first two, directed by Bryan Singer, were made before the saturation of comic book movie adaptations we have today and remain impressive, thrilling and a lot of fun. The disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine were the underwhelming series lows, while the pretty good X-Men: First Class and the underrated The Wolverine mostly succeeded in capturing the gruff, imaginative essence of the series. Now, with Singer returning to direct a series installment for the first time since 2003, the franchise mostly escapes superhero movie fatigue by finding a brilliantly clever new angle to explore.\nThe complex plot opens with the world we know becoming a dark, dreary place in the near future. All mutants are hunted and killed by man-made machines called Sentinels and the X-Men crew is sparse and holed up in China, awaiting possible extinction. By a means too convoluted to explain, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is sent back in time to change the past. His mission: in order to save the future and change the past, he must recruit younger versions of his mentor, Professor X and his adversary, Magneto; not only must he convince them of his quest but also get the two longtime enemies to work together.\nAll of the scenes set in the future, with the familiar crew of mutants fighting off the Sentinels and taking part in effects-heavy mayhem, are tired and feel overly familiar. Once the story settles into the 1970s and becomes a delightful, engaging time travel action/comedy, the movie takes off. I won\u2019t describe it, but there is an incredible scene, set to Jim Croce\u2019s \u201cTime in Bottle,\u201d that astonishes by blending state of the art CGI, crafty cinematography and a wicked sense of humor. While the movie never tops this sequence, there are other set-pieces that deliver on the excitement and spectacle promised by the series.\nUninitiated audiences should see the first two entries, in order to get up to speed.

Scale is a competitive advantage. As a result, a combined Yahoo and Microsoft makes a great deal of sense,\" Financial analyst Clayton Moran from Stanford Group Company said in an e-mail interview after the results were released.\nAsked whether he sees Yahoo as being on the right track or not, Moran, who has a \"Hold\" recommendation on the stock and a 12-month target of $24 per share, said: \"Yahoo is struggling with no clear solution to reignite growth.\"\nStill, Yahoo's top executives repeatedly said, during a conference call to discuss the results, that they were pleased with Yahoo's performance considering the challenges it has faced, including adverse economic conditions and the distractions of the Microsoft acquisition bid and the strident controversies it has generated.\n\"We're executing and delivering against the strategy we laid out, even under extraordinary conditions,\" said CEO Jerry Yang.\nCFO Blake Jorgensen said the conversion of joint broadband deals with AT&T and Rogers Communications to a revenue-sharing format, in late 2007 and early 2008, have hurt Yahoo's revenue growth this year.\nYahoo also said it saw economic conditions affect advertising revenue, especially in categories such as finance, travel and retail.\nYahoo this week managed to reach an agreement with Icahn, who had proposed an alternate slate of director candidates for the Aug. 1 shareholder meeting in order to unseat the entire board.

Icahn had indicated previously that his intention was to unseat Yang as Yahoo CEO and attempt to lure Microsoft back to the negotiating table, a possibility that now seems remote.\nThe proxy-contest settlement \"eliminates the distractions and allows us to move forward,\" Yang said.\nThe deal with Google raised eyebrows, since Google's dominance in search advertising is a big reason why Yahoo has struggled financially. Search advertising makes up about 40 percent of all online ad spending, and Google has a stranglehold on that segment of the market.\nBy comparison to Yahoo, Google last week reported second-quarter revenue of US$5.37 billion, up 39 percent over the same quarter last year.

The study holds potential for mitigating farmers\u2019 economic losses, but could also prove an important part of the conservation puzzle for the dwindling tiger population.\n\u201cIf we can understand what kind of landscape features these cats target when they\u2019re attacking livestock, then we can better predict where to graze, and predict where the high risk areas are,\u201d said Jennie Miller FES \u201915, the study\u2019s lead author who conducted the research for her dissertation.\nSimilar statistical models have been used in past research with wolves in the United States. Though Miller\u2019s model is based off of these, it is distinct because of the differences in large cats\u2019 hunting patterns.\nThe team studied the area within 20 square meters of each kill site. Though past models have focused on larger areas, tigers are more limited in their movements, and therefore, the wider radius is unnecessary.\nWild prey is available to the tigers, but so too is livestock, which the tigers may only attack when the opportunity arises \u2014 if a cow, for instance, had strayed into a densely forested area that the tiger already frequented. Thus, Miller said the model is likely to reduce attacks for many years to come because tigers are unlikely to shift behavior patterns in order to continue feeding on no-longer-easily-available cows.\nThe team worked in central India in the Kanha Tiger Reserve, where the large tiger population had produced more than 400 instances of attack on livestock within that year. The researchers partnered with the local livestock compensation program, through which farmers can report livestock lost to tiger predation to the forest department for reimbursement. This helped provide the team with the data they needed and began to elucidate the relationship between land features and risk.\nThough much of what the model predicted was relatively straightforward \u2014 attacks, for instance, were more frequent in areas farther away from villages and were less frequent in areas with less vegetation \u2014 it did help identify riskier areas in seemingly uniform landscapes.\nProfessor at the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and Miller\u2019s advisor Oswald Schmitz said that though policy to protect tigers already exists, Miller\u2019s work will prove that it really", "gold_completion": " is possible for humans and tigers to coexist peacefully.\nMiller said some changes based on the study, especially fencing in higher-risk areas of the park, are already going into effect.

In fact, she identified poaching as the number one challenge tigers face, adding that if it were scaled back, the population would have a solid chance at recovery.\nMiller\u2019s next study will look at farmers\u2019 perception of risk. Identifying the disparities between perceived and actual risk could help reduce tiger attacks even further, Miller said.\nThere are fewer than 3,500 wild tigers left in the world.\nA previous version of this article misstated the class year of Jennie Miller.

He also opposed the US troop withdrawal from Syria that Mr Trump announced on Wednesday, a move that has bewildered allies and triggered harsh reaction from Republican allies in Congress.\nMr Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the White House would not comment \"on future strategic developments\".\nThe US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thousands of the 14,000 troops could be sent home as a result of the deliberations, the disclosure of which could undermine peace efforts with the Taleban.\nMr Trump privately has been grousing about US military involvement in Afghanistan, telling an ally as recently as Wednesday, words to the effect of: \"What are we doing there. We've been there all these years.\"\nThe source, who asked to remain unidentified, said it appeared the President \"has lost all patience\" with the US military presence in Afghanistan.\nMore than 2,400 US forces have died in the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan, and Pentagon officials have repeatedly warned that a precipitous exit would allow militants to develop new plots on America like the Sept 11, 2001 attacks that plunged the US into an era of open-ended warfare.\nIt is unclear how the United States with less than 9,000 forces in Afghanistan will be able to fulfill the full set of missions now underway, including training Afghan forces, advising them in the field, and waging an air campaign against the Taleban and other militant groups.\nInstead, the United States almost certainly would have to curtail its missions, something that could provide an opportunity for a resurgent Taleban to expand their offensives across Afghanistan.\nMr Mattis had argued for maintaining a strong US military presence in Afghanistan to bolster diplomatic peace efforts. He resigned shortly after US officials raised the possibility that Mr Trump would order the drawdown.\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, often a vocal Trump ally, warned of possible danger to the US if the drawdown goes through.\n\"The conditions in Afghanistan - at the present moment - make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy.

{"prefix": "By Don Edwards Don Edwards, US representative from California, is chairman of the House Subcommitte on Civil and Constitutional Rights. He was the floor leader for House passage of extension of the Voting Rights Act.\nIf President Reagan and a handful of conservative senators succeed in their scheme to require plaintiffs in Voting Rights Act cases to prove ''intent'' to discriminate, the results will be tragic for minority Americans. A key provision of the bill passed by the House of Representatives on Oct. 5, 1981, by the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 389-24 will be struck down before it has become law.\nSection 2, which was designed in 1965 to remedy voting discrimination patterns wherever they might exist, authorizes the government or private individuals to ask the federal courts to stop discriminatory practices whether they occur in Mississippi, Alaska, California, or anywhere in the US. If President Reagan is successful in imposing his will, scores of blatantly discriminatory laws and pratices will be unreachable through lawsuits.\nWhen it approved the Voting Rights Act in 1965, it was Congress's intention that in lawsuits to enforce Section 2 the burden of proof on the complaining party not be limited to proof of intent or bad purpose. If discriminatory results were shown, a violation could be found. The House overwhelmingly restated this principle in extending the Voting Rights Act in 1981.\nSection 2 worked very well for the first 15 years of the Voting Rights Act. Suits were filed in jurisdictions where laws enacted many years ago had resulted in black citizens having little or no chance of being elected to local or state offices. These suits were not easy--they required a showing that an aggregate of factors were present in a particular jurisdiction.\nTo make this showing, substantial statistical and other evidence proving the discriminatory impact of voting and election practices and procedures in the local jurisdiction was needed. But important suits were won, and the 1965 intent of Congress in enacting Section 2 was being fulfilled.\nThen in April 1980 the US Supreme Court in a plurality, not a majority, decision overruled the lower court decisions and said that insofar as the City of Mobile, Ala. was concerned, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act could not be used to mandate single-member districts unless the officials who wrote the law back in 1911 had the intent to discriminate against blacks. The Court specifically said that it was not enough to prove the existence of an aggregate of factors, such as a history of segregation, discrimination in registration and voting, disproportionately low numbers of minorities elected to office, racial bloc voting, lack of responsiveness by local officials to minorities, and the lack of access to the political process.\nThe impact of the Mobile decision has been devastating. The US Justice Department abandoned its suit against South Carolina, 30 percent black, the sole remaining state in the Deep South with an all-white legislative body - the state senate. Indeed, a black has not been elected to the South Carolina state senate in this century. The Justice Department dismissed three additional suits, and dropped from consideration other possible suits in cities where black citizens have for decades been discriminated against in the electoral process.\nIn one case, a court, citing the Mobile decision, upheld an election system in Moultrie, Ga., where exclusion of blacks has gone so far that the town actually delegated the running of elections to an all-white social club.\nSince the Mobile decision in April 1980 the Justice Department has not inititated a single lawsuit under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nMobile has made Section 2 virtually irrelevant. Old laws obviously designed to prevent the election to public office of black Americans can no longer be reached in courts of law.

In creating the Voting Rights Act in 1965 Congress intended that proof or effect, results, was enough, and that to require proof of intent would be a nearly impossible burden. Without the House version of Section 2, the Voting Rights extension will be substantially weaker than the 1965 law.

{"prefix": "A \"vegetarian\" gene may have evolved amongst groups of people who have historically eaten less meat.\nA team at Cornell University describes the genetic variation in a study published inMolecular Biology and Evolution -- a variation that they say has \"evolved in populations that have eaten a plant-based diet over hundreds of generations\". That includes areas of India, Africa and East Asia, with a different variation adapted to a seafood diet found in Greenland.\nThe adaptation, the team says, allows those with the gene to \"more efficiently process omega-3 and omega-6 acids and convert them into compounds essential for early brain development and controlling inflammation\". The downside is that it might be linked to some types of cancer and other health problems.\nThe team looked at frequencies of particular alleles in 234 vegetarian people from India and 311 from the US, finding it in 68 percent of Indians and 18 percent of Americans. This is likely, they say, because Northern Europeans are more likely to eat meat and have \"a long history of drinking milk\".\nAdaptations between vegetarian and seafood diets is most striking -- the vegetarian allele has an insertion of 22 bases, something that's missing entirely from the seafood allele.\n\"The opposite allele is likely driving adaptation in the Inuit population,\" said Kaixiong Ye, co-lead author of the paper. \"Our study is the first to connect an insertion allele with vegetarian diets, and the deletion allele with a marine diet.\" \"Several studies have pointed to adaptation in this region of the genome", "gold_completion": ". Our analyses combine to show that the adaptation is driven by an insertion of a small piece of DNA that we know its function. Moreover, when it reached the Greenlandic Inuit, with their marine-based diet rich in omega-3, it might have become detrimental,\" she said.\nThe team are \"unsure\" when the adaptation first occurred, as similar analysis of chimpanzee genomes offered no discovery of the vegetarian allele. \"It is possible that in the history of human evolution, when people migrated to different environments, sometimes they ate a plant-based diet and sometimes they ate a marine-based diet, and in different time periods these different alleles were adaptive, meaning the alleles have a tendency to evolve under dietary pressures,\" said Ye.\nA recent study from Oxford University found that global adoption of a vegan diet could save more than eight million lives by 2050. Vegetarian diets could save up to 7.3 million, and greenhouse gases could be reduced by nearly 70 percent.", "no_wm_completion": ",\" noted co-author Daniel Lefkowitz. \"We believe that the same mechanism may be driving adaptation in other ancient populations as well.\"\nThe researchers say such a genetic variant could explain population-wide variations in omega3 and omega6 fatty acid content in humans. Previous evidence has found that many health problems, such as chronic inflammation and obesity, are associated with a lower dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids \u2013 particularly EPA and DHA.\nOmega3 and omega6 fatty acids are essential for brain development and the cardiovascular health of people. Eating too many omega3 and omega6 acids could weaken the protective effects of omega3 fatty acids, leading to problems in brain development or development of cardiovascular disease.\nFor an idea of how humans used to eat, the researchers looked at samples taken from a dozen Greenlandic people living in a single location and compared them to samples taken the same age from 14 people living in a few dozen different locations. The similarities were striking. \"These individuals", "gen_completion": ",\" noted co-lead study researcher Kaimen F. Lin from the US. The team's previous publication, also involving Asian people from the US and India, also suggested that the insertion was likely to drive evolution in human populations. But it has still never been definitively identified. The team's sequencing of the two genomes aligned the pieces together with a \"superior conservation model\", where genetic coding for different traits are \"copYRNId\" to avoid changing just one element completely. Genetic diversity increases with complexity leading by \"advanthood\", this analysis argues. The environmental stress on fish that causes adaptation (and possibly even cancer-causer omega-6 chemicals \"adipanol\" to decrease during the growth period before adulthood) would make humans almost certainly more resistant and genetically diverse so they might persist a bit better, or so they might, which means finding and exploiting these potential traits for good could generate more wealth for humanity in long run anyway -- on track to avoid resource crunch and making", "z_wm": 20.873863220214844, "z_human": -7.239300727844238, "simcse": 0.74462890625}

{"prefix": "In my Tai Chi classes we learn how to pay attention to what we are doing, for it is fundamental to being able to relax, stay balanced and move well.\nSometimes the first and most important step in learning to pay attention is simply experiencing just how difficult it is to do so. Unfortunately most people give up at this point but it is worth considering the implications of spending most of our time being unaware of what is happening both in and around us.\nTo learn anything or develop any skill you have to able to pay attention. For me it is the single most useful attribute that anyone could develop to improve all aspects of their life. Paying attention means to intentionally focus on what is happening in the present moment (both internally and externally) at any given time. It is the art of noticing things without the distraction of thinking and judgement; the art of empirical observation. Paying attention is very simple. It is so simple in fact that it is usually overlooked by almost all of us but actually it underpins everything that we do. To begin with it can be a bit of a tricky skill to develop for it is easy to assume that you are paying attention when in fact your mind is wandering. By training little and often even small improvement can foster great benefits.\nIn terms of how we move and use our bodies it is our ability to pay attention that governs the quality of our actions. A good boxer in a bout, for example, focuses purely on what is happening; he pays attention. He watches and senses his opponent for any precursors to attack or discrepancies in his defence. He is completely in his body, engulfed by accurate real time sense perception.

Most people have very low levels of body awareness and because this is very common in our society it goes largely unnoticed. If I go running, for example, without paying attention to how move then I can seriously hamper the quality of my movement because I ignore the vital feedback that my senses constantly deliver. This results in inefficient movement and usually injury at some point along the way.

This is not to say that all forms of meditation do not give us a similar result. A few minutes of mindfulness meditation a day can give an advantage even at the highest levels. I suspect that the way we think about the mind plays a large part in just how good this can get.\nMost of us never take the time to get our minds off the mind. If we are in a meeting it can be difficult to concentrate but then we may be a little distracted by someone chatting away at the other desk. We get caught up in other distractions at home or in the workplace and can\u2019t notice when our mind is wandering even for a minute.

{"prefix": "Officials are working to convince the public that a sweeping trade deal will help the planet.\nFacing criticism from green groups, the administration is making the case that a sweeping trade deal that President Obama is working to negotiate with Pacific Rim nations won't hurt the environment. In fact, officials argue, the agreement could go a long way toward protecting the planet.\nAs part of a push to sell the deal on Capitol Hill and to the American public, the U.S. trade representative and the State Department will unveil a report on Wednesday highlighting what they say are the potential environmental benefits of the international agreement, a pact that the president views as a cornerstone of his economic legacy.\nThe report arrives as Congress inches closer to passing so-called \"fast-track\" legislation backed by the White House, granting lawmakers an up-or-down vote on any trade deal.\nThe White House contends that the deal will bolster trade and help the United States maintain a competitive advantage in the face of China's rapid rise. But Democratic lawmakers, labor unions, and green groups remain wary of the agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, warning that it could undercut worker rights and erase key environmental safeguards.\nNow, the administration is pushing back against environmental criticism.\nFar from selling out the environment, officials say, the president has used trade as a lever to achieve far-reaching aims that will ultimately leave the environment in far better shape across a wide array of nations. Among those aims are agreements in the deal for countries to curb illegal wildlife-trafficking, fishing, and logging.\n\"We have the chance to finalize a trade agreement that is truly unlike any other ever negotiated: an agreement where every participant has to comply with core international labor and environmental standards. ... That's not a complicated choice,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said during a speech delivered in Washington state on Tuesday.\nThe State Department and the U.S. trade representative promise that every last one of those environmental obligations will be fully enforceable and achievable.\nThe administration says it plans to provide assistance in the form of grants and technical support to developing nations such as Brunei, Vietnam, and Malaysia to ensure that they have the ability to follow through on environmental commitments.\nOfficials are also quick to note that nations can be taken to task if they fail to live up to their end of the deal. Any country found in violation could face a formal dispute, which could ultimately result in sanctions.\nObama's trade deal would go well beyond the environmental provisions included in past international agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. And a slate of conservation groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy, have praised the administration for its pledge to create conservation safeguards in the agreement.\nThe White House hopes its push will win over critics. But it is unlikely to change hearts and minds among environmentalists dead set against the deal. Part of the reason is that many environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, say that their criticism of the agreement applies to provisions much broader than anything contained within the environmental chapter.\nCritics from these groups fear that the deal will usher in an onslaught of legal challenges intended to undermine environmental regulations while opening the", "gold_completion": " door for a flood of natural-gas exports to nations such as Japan.

Officials also argue that the idea that natural-gas exports will result in disastrous environmental consequences is overblown.\n\"Rest assured ... we will retain our ability to protect our clean air and water, regulate our economy, and uphold all of the laws of our nation.

{"prefix": "Above: A chatbot beats a travel app.\nMy travel season is coming up soon. I always attend CES in Las Vegas (let me know if you want to chat in person), the SxSW conference in Austin, and a few extra trips here and there. As I Iive up here in Minneapolis, it\u2019s the perfect time to escape the inevitable cold and snow.\nRecently, I\u2019ve been looking into travel options and, as a way to practice what I preach, I\u2019ve been relying entirely on messaging apps like Mezi (which uses AI to find the best deals). I\u2019ve talked to the Google Assistant on a Pixel smartphone I\u2019m testing and relied on chat interfaces. It\u2019s always interesting, as journalist, to apply what I\u2019m testing in my job to making actual plans. When you have to hand over your credit card information and other personal details, your perspective changes.\nAs it turns out, I learned quite a bit about why messaging works better for travel arrangements, mostly due to the time savings. It\u2019s amazing. On Mezi, I typed in my dates and the departure and arrival cities. That\u2019s it. The app is designed to make the process as fluid as possible, and it\u2019s all about finding the best deal. The app I normally use to book my own trips (when I even use an app instead of a website) is Expedia. Yet, I don\u2019t plan on going back to travel apps, and here\u2019s why.\nFirst, let\u2019s clear up one misconception. Making travel arrangements is not rocket science. There are a limited number of flights from Minneapolis to Las Vegas on the dates I\u2019m flying. For some reason, I always think if I spend an hour or more, I might find a better deal. That\u2019s rarely true.\nWhat is true is that most of the travel apps, even the ones that make big promises about saving you money, are searching the same basic airfare options. Sun Country offers roughly the same deal on every site, so a messaging app like Mezi already has a fairly limited number of options to analyze. From what I understand about how the app works, it searches for the best flights at the best times and provides three good options without too much help from a human agent.\nWhat\u2019s changed for me is that I trust the results. I know that these are likely the three best options, so I don\u2019t psyche myself out searching for more economical flights. It helps that I already know the flight should run about $300 or less (this is a vacation destination after all) and shouldn\u2019t make any stops.\nHere are some of the ways this saves me time. I don\u2019t have to use multiple travels apps and try to remember my login for each one. I don\u2019t have to fill out any forms \u2014 Mezi does that for me. I don\u2019t have to pick any flight preferences; Mezi saves this and fills it in. There are a few more subtle benefits, as well. I might need to update the Mezi app once in a while, but not as often as most of the apps I use, which seem to be constantly needing an update. Most of what needs to be updated in a messaging app is on the backend, not within the simple text interface.\nMaybe it\u2019s all an illusion, but I swear I saved about an hour.

I asked the agent to do the search once per day for a few days in a row. That way, it helped confirm to me that I wasn\u2019t missing a good deal. I was also able to ask about other details, like whether a certain airline still offers nonstop flights. I want to be able to have a conversation, and no chatbot that is 100% automated does that yet.\nFor my next trip, however, I do plan to try a chatbot that uses all AI.

{"prefix": "The Bulldogs season ended with a loss to Liberty in the NCAA Tournament.\nSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2013 Lamar Peters had a practice jersey wrapped around his neck. He leaned back in the corner of Mississippi State's locker room at the SAP Center in San Jose, California.\nHe looked as comfortable as he could, and he looked confident, too. His Bulldogs were set to take on Liberty in the first round of the NCAA Tournament roughly 24 hours from the time he sat there and said he felt Mississippi State was ready to turn some heads.\nFriday evening against the No. 12 seed Liberty Flames, Peters turned plenty of them as he scored 21 points and made four 3-pointers.\nBut the Flames turned more.\nLiberty beat the fifth-seeded Bulldogs, 80-76, to oust them from the tournament much sooner than they would have liked. Mississippi State's season ended abruptly after blowing a double-digit lead down the stretch.\n\"It's just a tough, tough pill to swallow, especially the way we had the lead that late in the game,\" MSU head coach Ben Howland said.\nTwo of the three best players on the floor for either team Friday were Peters and MSU senior guard Quinndary Weatherspoon. The best, though, was probably Liberty red-shirt junior Caleb Homesley, who scored 30 points and led Liberty's comeback.\nHomesley caught fire from 3-point range. He made five of his 11 shots from beyond the arc. Three of those came after Mississippi State had built a 10-point lead with roughly seven minutes to go.\n\"I think I just played confident,\" Homesley said. \"I think any shot i take is going to go in. It just happened that they were falling... It could have been anybody any given night, but tonight it was me.\"\nBefore Homesley's assault, the Bulldogs had everything working on both ends of the floor. They racked up eight blocks on the defensive end and wouldn't let Liberty get a good look at the basket. Offensively, Weatherspoon and Peters continued to pace the Bulldogs with a mixture of drives to the bucket and pull-ups from distance.\nWeatherspoon scored 27 points on 6-of-12 shooting in his final game in maroon and white. Any time Mississippi State needed a bucket, he drove to the rim and either made a layup or got to the free throw line, where he made 13 of his 16 shots.\n\"Lamar and I had it going,\" Weatherspoon said. \"I just give the credit to my teammates. I mwan, we all came out and played hard.\"\nThey played hard enough to hold a 63-53 lead with 7:11 left in the game. Then they collapsed. Howland said everything that could have went wrong for Mississippi State, well -- went wrong.\nWeatherspoon and Peters each picked up four fouls, and it affected Mississippi State's offensive flow. The ball ran through each of those players all night. The duo's mentality drastically changed when they got into foul trouble.\n\"It made us settle for threes because we didn't want to go out of control and draw a charge,\" Peters said", "gold_completion": ". \"So it made us play timid.\"\nPeters and Weatherspoon couldn't be as aggressive defensively on the perimeter as they had been previously, which allowed Homesley to get good looks from three. He almost single-handily turned the game on its head with 12 points in a four-minute stretch. Those 12 points gave Liberty a 69-67 lead with less than three minutes left.\nMississippi State eventually took a 70-69 lead, but Liberty senior guard Lovell Cabbil Jr. took after his teammate and popped a 3-pointer to give the Flames the lead again. They never looked back from there.\nSitting in a similar position as he did the day before -- slumped back in a chair with cameras in his face -- Peters wasn't feeling as calm and confident as the day before. Those emotions were replaced by dejection and despair.\n\"I felt like we had it,\" Peters said grimly. \"I felt like we had it.\"", "no_wm_completion": ". \"It definitely affected us emotionally, but also, the energy really got down from not scoring some points.\"\nHomesley kept Liberty right in the game from the beginning. He hit three 3-pointers with just under four minutes to play. The Flames still scored 17 of their final 18 points of the first half, but that lead was just five as the Bulldogs struggled to get a consistent shot at the basket, let alone a quality look at the basket.\nWeatherspoon didn't have a great game -- he finished 2-of-12 and shot 1-of-6 from 3-point range. But he made a play -- including a blocked shot and a 3-pointer -- when he needed to to keep the Bulldogs close.\nWeatherspoon finished with 13 points.\n\"Quinney just stepped up big-time,\" Weatherspoon said.\nHomesley, meanwhile, proved he is a matchup player in this tournament. He had the momentum with Liberty trailing", "gen_completion": " from the bench late into the game after taking three apiece. Lamar Peters got fouled on an alley up attempt with just 3:48 in late and drilled an 8-fter in his third attempt from the restricted field to make it 67-61.

He struggled to keep up offensively when Mississippi's lead disappeared from the game and the game flowed toward its finish anyway on an opposing court. He'll likely bounceback though on Saturday night to help lead the Liberty home where they'll look to end the regular season by coming out exactly against Mississippi's opponent to end the regular season.

Unstructured data could be things like handwritten doctors\u2019 notes pointing to things like your attitude, mood, family health history, and other things, Little said.\nBroken up into the categories of structured, semi-structured and unstructured, it isn\u2019t difficult to see how data could be used in similar ways despite belonging to different spaces.

{"prefix": "Republicans are, naturally, united in their opposition to the preliminary deal the Obama administration struck with Iran to restrain its nuclear program. And now, the presidential candidates in particular are going to compete with each other to see who can make their opposition more categorical. They're all criticizing it, of course, and Scott Walker has already said that on the day of his inauguration, he'll pull out of the deal. I'm guessing the rest of them will follow suit and pledge something similar. The question is: OK, so on January 20, 2017, you announce that we're out of the deal (since we're in the Republican fantasy world for the moment, let's put aside the involvement of Europe and the UN). What happens next?\nWell for starters, the Iranians would no longer be constrained by the things they agreed to. They could kick out all the inspectors and institute a crash program to create a nuclear weapon if they wanted. Are Republicans saying that Iran would never do that? I don't think so. Yet in practice, the Republican position seems to be: 1) We can never trust the Iranians to adhere to the terms of any nuclear deal we sign with them because of their insatiable thirst for nuclear weapons, so 2) If there's no agreement at all\u2014no limits on nuclear research, no limits on the quantity and purity of uranium they can enrich, no inspections\u2014then everything will be OK.\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this deal is perfect, though a lot of people who know a lot about this issue are arguing that it's far stronger than what they expected (see here, for instance). But Republicans aren't saying we need to reopen negotiations and push for something better. They're just saying we should scrap the agreement, and then ... well, they actually don't say what happens then.\nIn effect, the Republican argument is, We've put this dangerous criminal in prison, but I don't think this prison is secure enough. He might escape!

Or are you just saying that if we scrap it and reimpose sanctions on Iran, then they'll capitulate to all our demands?

After all, Iran has been under sanctions from the U.S., the EU, and many other countries for years, yet their nuclear program has continued. What will be different without an agreement?\nWe should hear conservatives out on all their specific complaints about this deal. They might have a case to make about particular weaknesses. But in every case, we have to ask: What's your alternative?

This time around I don't think it's necessary to tell us what the Republican candidates are saying. And the reason is simple: They're not saying what they think we should be taking away; they're basically just saying we should do nothing about this.

{"prefix": "In the week following the announcement of PostScript Level 3, PCDN spoke to Ian Mitchell, Adobe's European OEM business manager, about page description languages (PDLs), the Web, and Hewlett-Packard's (HP) decision to forsake the standard.\nPCDN: What's a capsule summary of PostScript Level 3? It's being painted as `PostScript for the Web'. Is that right?\nThe whole thing is it brings freer exchange of information between PDF and PostScript so you can print any digital document without losing look and feel. It's a new paradigm of distribute-and-print, rather than print-and-distribute. It's a complete democracy of where you print. We do it all so users don't have to worry about it. For example, in the office where you have a PostScript Level 2 printer you would push a PostScript file byte by byte so it would be slow. PDF is structured in much more intelligent way so that's not necessary.\nIt was a mistake to introduce [PostScript] Level 2 and leave it a year before products and longer for drivers. Drivers will be available immediately with the release of Level 3. Level 3 will be much more of an architecture. Level 2 was a new Red Book. We'll work closely with Microsoft, Apple and others to bring a new component system into place.\nWhen can we expect the first Level 3-based products?\nThe first products will ship in the third quarter of 1997. We're announcing now because we want ISVs to become aware of it although we'll openly publish very little until the first products appear.\nHow much will HP's decision not to use PostScript in the future hurt you?\nIt's a double-edged sword. HP's defection isn't a sign that they don't [like Adobe technology]. To Adobe, it's a revenue and PR loss but it's a recognition that HP sees us as too dominant. On the other hand it allows us to be far more aggressive in positioning ourselves against PCL, which we haven't been able to do in the past. HP hasn't abandoned us; it's only the laser printer side.\nBut I think they've shot themselves in the foot. If you look at the way printing is going, it's all towards colour and speed. To add the same functionality as PostScript to PCL, you'll have to add the same cost.

The next step is Personal PostScript, and the best is Level 3.\nThe Web will change everyone's lives and we think we have the technology to [help with] that. HTML is always going to be there.

For starters, determining whether their face-of-the-franchise ace\u2019s future is in Los Angeles.\nClayton Kershaw originally had until Wednesday at 9 p.m. PT to opt out of the two years remaining on his contract. But Kershaw and the Dodgers agreed to extend the deadline to Friday at 1 p.m. PT, which offers more time to possibly come to terms on a deal that would keep Kershaw in Los Angeles for longer than the next two seasons.\nNeither offered specifics on the negotiations.\nThe club did remove one thing from its checklist Thursday, signing David Freese and saving $1 million doing it. The Dodgers held a $6 million team option to on Freese, but paid him a $500,000 bonus and then signed him to a one-year, $4.5-million deal.\nThe Dodgers have until 2 p.m. Friday to extend the one-year, $17.9 million qualifying offer to their free agents. Yasmani Grandal and Hyun-Jin Ryu are candidates to receive the offer. Manny Machado, another free agent, isn\u2019t eligible to receive the qualifying offer because he was traded during the season.

The Dodgers engaged Roberts in contract discussions during the season without reaching an agreement. Roberts has said he would like to return and the Dodgers have said they would like to retain him.\nOn Thursday, Friedman and Zaidi defended Roberts\u2019s decision-making during the World Series, particularly in Game 4 when he pulled pitcher Rich Hill in the seventh inning with a four-run lead after Hill had held the Red Sox scoreless over 6 1/3 innings.\nFriedman and Zaidi attributed the team\u2019s troubles in the World Series to the offense\u2019s struggles. Machado was acquired during the regular season to help the Dodgers avoid those spells, but the shortstop went 4 for 22 with a walk and zero extra-base hits in the five games while adding to his reputation as someone allergic to hustling. Machado is expected to sign a mega contract this winter as either a shortstop or third baseman.\nThe Dodgers have third baseman Justin Turner under contract for $39 million the next two seasons and are \u201coptimistic\u201d that Corey Seager, whose injuries created the hole at shortstop that Machado filled, will be ready for Opening Day next spring. Seager has undergone elbow ligament replacement and hip surgeries. A return to Los Angeles for Machado is unlikely.\nTo retain Machado \u2014 or sign slugger Bryce Harper or any other marquee free agent \u2014 would almost certainly require the Dodgers to surpass the luxury tax threshold. That\u2019s a line they mindfully dropped under in 2018.

But that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re doing when you cook out on a gas grill, which is powered by the same largely flavorless fuel as your kitchen stove.\nTrue fact: Cooking on a gas grill is more convenient than cooking with charcoal.\nIt\u2019s also a lot less special. And, scientifically speaking, it creates less flavorful food.\nTrue fact: A gas grill is more convenient. But it also creates less flavorful food.\nIn other words, a burger is more than the sum of its ingredients. Sure, there are chemical processes occurring in your food that alter its flavors as it heats \u2013 amino acids interacting with sugars, fats breaking down, and so on \u2013 but this delicious chemistry happens whether you cook on gas, charcoal, an electric burner, even an engine block.\nWhat charcoal brings to the party is a healthy heaping of aroma compounds, the other half of the power couple that is flavor.
