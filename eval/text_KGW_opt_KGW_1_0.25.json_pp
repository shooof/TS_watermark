It ranked the top applicants with post-Alice allowance withdrawals. Unsurprisingly IBM, eBay and Microsoft were the top three assignees, named in 47, 19 and 15 applications respectively.

{"prefix": "The Seven Cs of Political Leadership!\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today.\nAs I sit down on the eve of my 40th birthday to write this editorial, I couldn't have thought of writing on a more important aspect -- as great political leadership is what India requires more than anything else today. And though I have written considerably on leadership, it has mainly been about corporate leadership.\nLeadership in corporations is massively different from political leadership, and therefore it requires a special model and a special line of thinking. While in corporations the final aim is profit maximisation in most cases, in politics the final objective is necessarily social welfare maximisation.\nWhile in corporations the best leaders are often the best marketing guys, in politics the best leaders necessarily have to be the people who are the sincerest and most hard working. While in business you can make do without the knowledge of economics, in politics that can be suicidal. While in business being unethical can harm you and at most your stake holders, in politics the lack of ethics ruins an entire nation's future.\nAnd most importantly, while in corporations leadership is about commitment to the strongest and survival of the fittest, in political leadership, the focus always is about commitment to the weakest and survival of the weakest. Thus, for me, political leadership is not just about having certain qualities but also simultaneously about not having various qualities. Rather, what is important is to ensure that one does not possess certain specific qualities first; if that is taken care of, the rest would then automatically fall in place.\nKeeping all the above in mind, I believe the model of the seven winning virtues of political leadership (viz credibility, compassion, clairvoyance, camaraderie, commitment, charisma and competence) that I have developed is most suited for Indian politicians in particular.\nWell, the difference in this model and any other such model is that in this model, each element or virtue is actually the opposite of one of the seven sins of life -- the seven deadly sins that we are supposed to avoid; to a large extent, as normal human beings and to an almost extreme extent, as a political leader! The first sin that a leader must avoid is that of greed. This is what seems to be the biggest problem with political leaders in India.

The second sin every politician needs to avoid is gluttony.\nThe next sin a leader must avoid is the sin of sloth. Sloth is being spiritually and emotionally apathetic and being physically and emotionally inactive. The fourth sin that leaders must avoid is envy. The fifth sin to avoid is the sin of lust. It refers to the way politicians have been doing things -- from threats to hide their lust filled deeds to even murders.\nThe sixth sin that political leaders need to avoid is the sin of pride! And that brings us to the final deadly sin that every political leader should avoid. The sin of wrath. This is what political leadership all about -- avoiding the seven keys sins and instead developing the seven winning virtues to lead their countries towards a better future. That's what great leaders were all about. Their lives are a lesson in avoiding the seven sins and delivering on the winning virtues! May a day come when Indian leaders are full of these seven virtues.", "no_wm_completion": " of many hundreds of millions of people who are suffering like this every day.\nSo the first sin is that of greed; it must be avoided. I don't want to get into the discussion whether greed is bad or not, but it certainly does not seem good for a country, and for the leader. On the way, greed also tends to be accompanied by a lot of arrogance and selfishness; in short, one tends to believe that he or she is not only right, but also important and very much superior to everyone else.\nSo, the first sin of leadership is not just greed; it is actually the complete lack of appreciation of the social environment in which it is possible for any leader to thrive.\nThe second sin of the Indian politician is that of complacency. This is the very reason why Indians do not really have a culture of progress and development, despite all the efforts of the leaders and of some media pundits to paint it as the way to go.

You can't build anything that is not owned by a group and there can be no business unless somebody has agreed to buy it. Hence, greed is a core part of political leadership in the form of corruption, nepotism, nepotismus(sic) etc.\nClairvoyance: Claryvoyance is that rare attribute of a political leader that makes him", "z_wm": 2.9876909255981445, "z_human": -5.38283109664917, "simcse": 0.81396484375}
{"prefix": "When it comes to safety in the workplace, organizational culture can be quite literally a matter of life and death. Look no further than the example of BP.\nAs one of the world's largest oil producers, BP has a troubled safety record. As Forbes reports, one of BP's plants has an unusually tragic past, including an explosion in 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured 180. This plant also reported 23 worker fatalities in the three decades that preceded the 2005 accident.\nWhen Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refiner in the U.S., bought the plant from BP, many in the industry thought it was a risky move. But Marathon had ideas for how to rectify the situation by instituting a culture centered on safety.\nRemedying the culture required a review of the plant's existing safety procedures. Following the 2005 explosion, federal investigators pointed to BP's problematic safety culture -- for example, with managers who were \"checking off boxes\" rather than promoting best practices for safety -- as the cause of the plant's many safety problems. BP failed to respond and paid dearly for its inaction in 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 and spilling more than 3 million barrels of oil. The incident cost the company $54 billion in damages.\nAs BP's record illustrates, organizational culture matters a great deal to employee safety. Cultures in which employees are engaged in their work are safer places to work. Gallup's 2016 meta-analysis study -- which examined more than 82,000 business units and 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations, across 49 industries and in 73 countries -- shows that business units with engagement scores in the top quartile of Gallup's employee engagement database have 70% fewer safety incidents compared with bottom-quartile units.\nTheir employees are committed to doing quality work. When workers are committed to a standard of excellence in all they do, it's natural for them to adhere to best practices that prevent safety incidents. When employees are dedicated to quality, they go the extra mile to do things right the first time. By taking the right strategic action -- for example, by holding employees accountable for quality -- leaders can develop a workforce that makes smart decisions throughout the day and promotes a culture of workplace safety.\nThe mission or purpose of the company makes employees feel their job is important. Many of the world's most engaged organizations maintain a purpose-driven culture. Their leaders know why the company exists and ensure that employees understand and identify with that purpose. When workers embrace the mission of an organization and connect with that purpose both personally and professionally, they are more likely to think \"big picture\" in all areas of their work. Employees who are aligned with the company's mission are also more likely to approach their work with thoughtfulness and attention to detail, which contributes to a culture of safety.\nEmployees feel that their opinions count. It's a simple notion: Listen to workers who are closest to the action. These individuals offer a front-line perspective on organizational problems and often are well-versed in preventing and overcoming them. Leaders should encourage employees to watch for hazards and should make it easy for them to share their feedback and concerns. Most importantly, when leaders act on the information they receive, it demonstrates to employees that their opinions matter -- and it can help companies avoid preventable safety incidents.\nAn unsafe workplace can have far-reaching effects on a company and its employees. Productivity can suffer, and insurance claims can significantly damage a company's bottom line. But no company can quantify the cost of the most serious accidents. Any expenses to the business pale in comparison with the infinite cost to", "gold_completion": " the families of the individuals whose lives were tragically lost on the Deepwater Horizon or who were killed or injured in the BP refinery explosion.\nGiven the potential consequences of a safety incident, leaders can't afford to be haphazard about safety. Regardless of industry or company size, all businesses need to do everything in their power to develop an engaged workforce that is committed to avoiding safety incidents. This means ensuring that employees are committed to quality work, believe in their company's mission and purpose and are confident in expressing their opinions. To keep employees safe, leaders need to create a culture of safety.\nFor former BP employees, the Marathon Petroleum acquisition -- and the cultural changes that have followed -- may create a safer environment that is the difference between life and death. As CEO Gary Heminger put it, \"We've taken our culture into that refinery. We're going to operate it with the best safety and environmental skills available.\"\nStephanie Plowman contributed to the research in this article.", "no_wm_completion": " a company's employees.\nThis is just one of the many reasons leaders need to promote and maintain a culture of safety. When leaders prioritize their company vision and mission and take action on their employees' concerns, it can make a big difference in how a company is perceived.

As part of the company's revival, Moxey is teaming back up with DJ Premier for a new single, \"Our Streets\" feat. A$AP Ferg, set to drop tomorrow (Nov. 3).\nWhen Moxey first launched Payday 25 years ago, it was at the center of New York's golden age of hip-hop, with Premier heavily involved as one of the go-to producers and, alongside Guru in Gang Starr, key artists in the scene at the time. In 1995, Payday also released the first-ever single from Jay-Z, \"In My Lifetime,\" a year before his debut album Reasonable Doubt was released in June 1996, and released a slew of albums and singles from the likes of WC and the MAAD Circle, O.C. and UTD, Mos Def's first hip-hop group.\nAlongside Premier, Payday has deals with New Orleans MC Pell, Atlanta veteran OJ Da Juiceman, U.K. rapper Yung Fume and NYC collective Gloss Gang.\n\"Hip-hop has become a global language, and I think the new Payday is here to reflect that and to help bring a bunch of diverse and talented new artists to the world,\" Moxey tells Billboard. \"Our first signings are from four different cities: New York, Atlanta, New Orleans and London.

Moxey sees Payday as both a global hub for hip-hop and one that will reflect the cultural aspects of its original era, beyond just music.\n\"It was a magic time in New York,\" he says about the company's origins, \"at a moment when hip-hop was very cultural: it was about the music, it was about the photographers, it was about the video makers, Triple Five Soul, many different aspects of it.

Phil Murphy a bill that will require nearly all New Jerseyans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, in a bid to stabilize premiums for consumers in the Obamacare marketplace.\nThey approved another bill that would set up a reinsurance plan that would be paid partly for by the federal government and cover some of the most expensive health care claims.\n\"It's a two-pronged attack to get at premium costs,\u201d said Linda Schwimmer, president and chief executive officer of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, a research and advocacy group.\nThe mandate bill passed 23-13 in the Senate and 50-23 in the Assembly. The reinsurance bill passed 22-14 in the Senate and 46-22 in the Assembly. Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal in the video above discusses the state's plans to protect Obamacare.\nThe bills would most directly affect consumers who don't get health insurance through Medicare or their employer. About 275,000 people in New Jersey were covered in the individual market, according to federal data released this month.\nThey are steps by the Democrat-controlled Legislature to protect the Affordable Care Act in the face of opposition from the Trump administration and Congress.\nOne of the biggest fights: New Jersey would reinstate the so-called individual mandate that requires most New Jerseyans to have health insurance or pay a penalty \u2014 either 2.5 percent of their household income or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, whichever is greater.\nThe Trump administration eliminated the contentious provision for 2019 as part of the tax reform law, and it turned its attention to giving states more flexibility to offer less expensive \u2014 and less comprehensive \u2014 plans.\nNew Jersey long has required insurance companies to provide \"essential\" benefits that mirrored Obamcare: hospitalization, maternity care and preventive care such as colorectal screenings, to name a few.\nThe bill headed to Murphy would penalize consumers who purchase a plan that doesn't include comprehensive benefits.\nMost New Jersey consumers buying health insurance through the Obamacare marketplace have an income that is low enough to qualify for subsidies. If they don't, the price is steep; a four-person family pays about $23,000 a year, according to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning research group.\nA recent Rutgers University poll found just 40 percent of New Jerseyans thought the state should continue the mandate, but health care experts have", "gold_completion": " said it would help stabilize premiums.\nWithout it, they said, young, healthy people would drop out of the market, leaving older and less healthy people stuck with the bill, making health care even less affordable.\nThe result: Premiums in New Jersey were expected to increase up to 32 percent next year \u2014 and 90 percent over the next three years \u2014 because of uncertainty in the insurance market, according to a report released by California's insurance marketplace.\n\"Health insurance works when everyone is in,\" state Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, and one of the bill's sponsors, said last month.\nThe reinsurance bill would create a program to pay for high-cost patients. It would be funded by both the federal government and insurance companies.

Coverage for mental health care is now not technically covered, because it could be offered at a discount.\nThe first year of the reinsurance plan would be funded by the federal government through a new fee that would help cover costs for high-risk customers.\nThe second year would be funded by individual premiums and the state. Under the plan, insurance companies would have a higher incentive to offer comprehensive plans, Schwimmer said.\nThe proposal for reinsurance is aimed at those who might have a difficult time finding other insurance plans \u2014 people who are the hardest to help since they already have fewer benefits and higher costs, she said.\n", "gen_completion": " said it is a net tax that has helped drive down the cost of insurance for people who didn't have coverage in the first place.\nNew Jersey would fund the individual mandate with revenue from the Medicaid expansion and by cutting tax credits, which could push premiums higher still, said health policy experts.\nA third bipartisan measure, sponsored by Sen.

It was a special pie in that I had never heard of elderberries. Personally, I still think that they taste a little like blueberries. This fruit was amazing. Don\u2019t ever turn down an elderberry pie if you have an option to have a piece. I have found that these elderberries are not widely known, but everyone that I know that has tasted these berries has loved them. From what I can see over the years this elderberry is loved by a variety of different wildlife, which will provide some competition.\nFrom my own experience I can seriously say to my reader who asked me for help with this wonderful plant a person who wants to grow them in Summit County will have success with a modest amount of effort. The only trial is that there are 25 different species around the world and at least six different cultivars of Elderberries and each of these have different requirements to some extent.\nThere are a number of different nurseries in the area that do raise elderberries. I have grown two different elderberries in my yard with success over the years. For me I think of this plant as more of a medium to tall shrub because it can grow from 5 to 12 feet tall. This compound leaf shrub does the best in moist soils but will tolerate dry soil, soil pH does not have much effect on this shrub, but grows suckers very well, because it grows stolons like strawberries.\nYou will have to prune this shrub regularly for this plant to do well. Over the centuries elderberry has been grown in hedges to access the fruit. Challenges to elderberry are a variety of borers, cankers and leaf spots, which can be serious to these plants. If you wanted more elderberry plants, you can propagate them by cuttings and seeds. Sambucus canadensis or American elder is considered a native bog plant found from Nova Scotia to Florida to Texas originally introduced in 1761 from Europe.\nSambucol a wonderful cold, cough and fever treatment an Israeli medication that we can find here in the U.S. has as the base Sambucus nigra leaves or fruit. What you can do is make a tea of the drupe or berry and some of the dried leaves as treatment even for the flu and other virus based diseases.\nAt the Kibbutz Aza in Israel many people in the Kibbutz came down with the flu so they tested Sambucol. Twenty percent of these flu sufferers showed significant relief of fever, muscle aches and other symptoms within 24 hours, 73 percent felt better after the second day, and in three days 90 percent were completely cured.\nMany cultures have used this elderberry or sambucus nigra fruit as a juice for treating tonsillitis. This sambucol stimulates the immune system and has shown success against Epstein-Barr, herpes, and even HIV. If you make a tea out of the dried leaves you may find help for arthritis, inflammation, viruses and cancer. The flavonoids in elderberries are high in anti-oxidants such as vitamin C, which has 87 percent of the RDA, Vitamin A with 17 percent RDA, and includes iron, potassium, vitamin B6 and lots of beta carotene. Flowers from the elderberry can be used as an antiseptic wash or poultice to treat wounds or eye inflammations.\nElderberries are also a favorite among many birds for many reasons.

There is nothing wrong with taking the time to help an elderberry get started and bloom into a wonderful old plant.\nI hope you try this out and can find places to grow elderberry trees and shrubs. I have enjoyed taking care of these plants. You can email me at paulschultz3@gmail.com to reach me. Best wishes. Paul Schultz\nLove 1 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\nSign up", "gen_completion": " plant.

{"prefix": "As the Obama administration winds down more than a decade of war, the budget request \u2014 only fragments of which were released Thursday \u2014 is supposed to account for cuts of $487 billion in projected spending over the next 10 years.\nPentagon officials said their proposal represented tough choices, but the biggest cuts appeared to be in the Defense Department's plan to reduce the number of U.S. ground forces to slightly more than on Sept. 10, 2001, before the wars began.\nAt the same time, the department proposed increasing spending on technology and major weapons systems, after a strategic announcement earlier this month in which defense officials said they must be ready for all kinds of warfare and proposed greater use of unmanned aircraft and a more agile ground force.\nIt wants to raise spending on drones by 30 percent, delay spending on the costly and controversial F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and fund a new bomber and a sea-based vessel that would allow drones and helicopters to take off from international waters. It wants to maintain current spending levels on missile defense and nuclear weapons while increasing spending on cybersecurity.\nTthe department sought to assert that it was simultaneously taking risks and not losing any conventional capability. It said it was responding to growing fiscal pressures because this proposal represented the biggest cut it had made in a decade.\nTheir proposal, officials have said, carries risks because the U.S. military no longer would be able to fight two wars simultaneously and might be required to make difficult decisions about military priorities.\n\"The primary risk lies not in what we can do but in how much we can do and how fast we can do it,\" said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nFor the 2013 fiscal year, the department requests a $525 billion base budget \u2014 a $6 billion decrease from the current budget \u2014 and an additional $88.4 billion in supplemental funding for the war in Afghanistan, down from $115 billion this year.\nFor 2014, the request for the base budget \u2014 which excludes war spending \u2014 jumps to $534 billion; by fiscal year 2017 it reaches $567 billion.\nThe department, which expanded the size of its ground forces quickly over the past decade to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, plans to cut the Army by 2017 to 490,000 soldiers from the current 562,000. Over the same period, the Marines would shrink by 20,000 to 182,000.\nThat would still leave a larger military than before the wars started. In 2001, there were 480,000 soldiers and 180,000 Marines.\nIn line with the smaller forces, the Pentagon calls for retiring planes that transport troops, including 27 C-5As and 65 C-130s. The budget also proposes modest limits on pay raises that would take effect in 2015 \u2014 after the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan is expected to be over \u2014 and increases in health care premiums.\nPanetta said the administration would ask Congress to authorize another round of cuts at U.S. military bases through the base realignment and closure process, which was last employed in 2005. He didn't offer specifics.\nRegardless, the suggestion alone could spark outrage on Capitol Hill, especially in an election year. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Thursday that he wouldn't support closing domestic bases before U.S. bases in Europe were shuttered.\nRep. William \"Mac\" Thornberry, R-Texas, called the proposal for a new BRAC round \"ridiculous, and there is likely little support in Congress for such a thing, on either side of the aisle or either side of the Capitol.

Its budget proposal reflects that, with spending for an 11th aircraft carrier and weapons system that could respond to China's growing military strength.\nThe department said it planned to cut two brigades from Europe and, according to Panetta, commit more troops to Asia, but he didn't offer specifics Thursday.\nThe department plans to save billions more by delaying production of the F-35, the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history. Bloomberg News reported that the projected expenditure on the system would be $9.2 billion, which would buy 29 of the fighters, 13 fewer than initially planned.\nOfficials said they hoped that the delay would give developers time to correct the myriad technical problems plaguing the program. But experts warn that prolonging production could raise its costs.\nThe Obama administration is expected to announce its full 2013 budget proposal in early February.", "no_wm_completion": " a plan to solve our nation's pressing military challenges.\"\nThe department also recommended closing several foreign military bases around the world, but made no major cuts to some.\nIt proposed cutting facilities at Qatar, Colombia, Qatar and Turkey, where some U.S. forces are deployed, but also maintaining a small contingent at Balad Air Base in Iraq.\nOn the battlefield, the Pentagon said it would keep current spending levels on the F-35 fighter, which costs far more than the rest of the military aircraft program.\nIt recommended funding for a fleet of F-35s and for long-range bombers, but not spending on a new long-range sea-based platform that would allow aircraft to fly from U.S. territories in the Caribbean and beyond.\nThe budget also proposed increasing spending on cyber defense, especially on computer technology, which is being used in new ways to control networks. It would also spend $150 million to accelerate the Navy's work on emerging aircraft carriers.", "gen_completion": " a plan to solve the nation's fiscal problems.\"\nThe Pentagon proposal represents a marked departure from the priorities laid out during the Obama administration, which proposed $731.5 billion for the budget year that began Oct. 1, 2012, only months after Republicans took control of Congress. It created a vast Pentagon bureaucracy, hiring thousands of employees and authorizing billions for costly new gear.\nRepublicans have also sought to return the wars to their early years, which began with the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers has said war spending was overstated during the last administration and had to come down.\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If many of them took advantage, Facebook\u2019s stock could decline, because the market would be flooded with shares.\nIt's not yet known whether any of those investors had sold any stock because they have three business days to disclose sales, said Sam Hamadeh, the CEO of PrivCo, which researches privately held companies.\nBut many of them likely did, he said. \"A lot of people have been waiting,\" Hamadeh said. \"Facebook was expected to go public a long time ago.\"\nVenture capitalists who invested in Facebook as early as 2005 were likely itching to sell at the earliest opportunity.

{"prefix": "The latest outbreak was swiftly contained by a fast, decisive response, acting as a model for containing infectious diseases in remote places.\nAs anti-climaxes go, it was a most welcome one. On May 11, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) notified the World Health Organization that one of its citizens had been infected with the Ebola virus. The announcement marked the start of the country\u2019s first Ebola outbreak since the historically unprecedented West African epidemic that infected 28,000 people between 2014 and 2016, and killed more than 11,000.\nBut after just 42 days, it was all over.\nWith the last confirmed patient having tested negative for the virus for the second time in a row, the WHO declared an end to the outbreak on Sunday. Just four people had died, and just four more had become infected.\nBut just as importantly, once the first cases were confirmed, the response was fast, decisive, and coordinated\u2014all qualities that were initially missing in West Africa. The DRC response shows that when everything goes right, Ebola can be quickly brought to heel, even when it hits poor, remote places. \u201cWith the end of this epidemic, DRC has once again proved to the world that we can control the very deadly Ebola virus if we respond early in a coordinated and efficient way,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s new Director-General, in a statement.\nThe symptoms of Ebola are greatly exaggerated in the popular press. It\u2019s not a disease of apocalyptic hemorrhaging from every orifice, and symptoms can easily be mistaken for other maladies. In this case, the first patient\u2014a 45-year-old man who contracted the virus on 22 April\u2014initially went to see a traditional healer. When that didn\u2019t work, he took a taxi to a health center\u2014and died on the way. (Both the driver, and a third individual who cared for the man, also eventually died.) The center quickly suspected Ebola and immediately sent samples to a national laboratory in Kinshasa. The staff there had the right knowledge, training, and connections\u2014they ran some preliminary tests while also calling international colleagues. Rimoin flew over with the latest diagnostics.\nAfter the first positive case was confirmed, the government immediately notified the WHO, which activated their emergency protocols. That inaccessibility of Likati was both a blessing and a curse\u2014it made it harder for the virus to spread, but also harder for health workers to reach the infected zone. Fortunately, after the sluggish response to the West African Ebola epidemic, the WHO had set up a $41 million contingency fund to ensure that money would be readily available for future emergencies. This fund allowed them and other organizations to quickly rent helicopters for flying personnel, generators, and supplies into Likati. \u201cWithin 24 hours, we could start airlifting,\u201d says Ibrahima-Soce Fall, director of the health security and emergencies cluster at the WHO\u2019s African office.\nThe team set up a base camp and", "gold_completion": " field lab in the grounds of a former convent.

They spread out through the region\u2019s villages to improve accessibility by fixing bridges and forest tracks. With training from UNICEF and the WHO, they taught local communities how to stop Ebola from spreading, how to safely bury people who die from the disease, and how to disinfect affected homes.\nThe outbreak may be over, but the response continues. For the next 90 days, the WHO will continue to strengthen health services in the region, to ensure that local volunteers are trained to spot possible symptoms should the disease arise again.

It also put a team on the ground to ensure the response was both effective and accessible. \u201cWhen the government has control of the information, it is much more difficult for someone to get in and out,\u201d says Fall. \u201cThat was a big problem during the Ebola outbreak. With this outbreak, there was a real commitment to get in and make sure that the teams and the workers had access to everything.\u201d A key piece of that strategy was the deployment of 1,200 Ebola responders, including hundreds of health workers.\nThese responders are a vital piece of the puzzle.", "gen_completion": " a treatment center at a school just outside of the city, staffed with at least 50 health workers.

{"prefix": "For decades, U.S. schools have failed to provide students with an adequate civics education, which is integral to building and maintaining an engaged and informed voting population.\nHow bad is it? According to the 2018 Annenberg Constitution Day Civics Survey, only 32 percent of Americans can name all three branches of the U.S. government. Even worse, 33 percent could not correctly name one branch.\nUnfortunately, this lack of basic civics knowledge is not restricted to U.S. adults. In 2014, only 23 percent of American students earned a proficient score on the civics portion of the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card\u201d exam. Needless to say, this does not bode well for the future.\nGiven these startling statistics, one would assume that American educators would be working feverishly to find new ways to improve civics courses. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. Only nine states and the District of Columbia require a full year of civics education as a requirement for high school graduation. Thirty-one states require students enroll in only one half-year course.\nAlthough several solutions have been proposed by educators and researchers to solve the civics crisis, none have been widely adopted. One of the most significant civics-related proposals is to require all high school students to pass the U.S. citizenship test, the same test that all immigrants must earn a passing score on before becoming a citizen. Although the movement started with much fanfare, it has since fizzled out; only 17 states have such a requirement.\nSchools are failing miserably to educate millions of Americans in basic civics. However, all is not lost. With a few reasonable changes, a civics education Renaissance is more than attainable.\nAs a former public high school teacher, one who taught courses in both American government and U.S. history, I have firsthand experience in the civics classroom crisis. Like many who have taught these courses before, I believe it is virtually impossible to provide children with the civics education they need in an eight-week civics \u201ccrash course.\u201d It\u2019s simply not enough time to dive into this important and complex subject. Civics, at the very least, should be a full-year course, and students should be offered opportunities to take additional, more advanced civics courses as well.\nSecond, civics standards need a total overhaul. It\u2019s not enough to teach kids how bills become laws, they need to know more about their rights as Americans and understand the history behind the constitutional protections they have been provided. The United States is an exceptional place, but most students are being taught the opposite is true. Yes, some truly terrible things have happened in America \u2014 just as they have in all countries \u2014 but the United States\u2019 commitment to personal freedom has made America the most powerful, wealthy, successful nation the world has ever seen. Students need to understand these ideas. Civics isn\u2019t about laws, it\u2019s about rights and personal freedom.\nThird, state standards are too narrowly focused on knowledge attainment. States typically don\u2019t offer students any form of experiential learning as part of their civics standards. No wonder youth participation in politics is abysmally low. If schools want to improve civics scores, they should teach children why civics is important, and the best way to do that is by getting them directly involved with the lawmaking process through internships, volunteer opportunities, and field trips to local and state government buildings, including state capitols.\nAnother way to increase student engagement is to emphasize student government in schools. If students are able to get actively involved in the governance of their own schools", "gold_completion": ", it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll have a greater interest in the governance of their communities in the future.\nFourth, and perhaps most important, students and parents should be given access to universal education savings accounts, which allow kids to go to any school their parents like. This would permit parents who care about civics to have the option of enrolling their children in schools that teach the values they are most concerned with.\nAlthough these solutions will not solve the civics crisis overnight, they would be a step in the right direction. But in order for any of this to occur, teachers and parents need the freedom and flexibility to accomplish these goals \u2014 flexibility they have been denied by bureaucrats and some disinterested politicians who have proven repeatedly they don\u2019t care about improving civics.\nAchieving progress requires a completely different approach.\nChris Talgo is a former public high school teacher and an editor at The Heartland Institute. He wrote this for InsideSources.com.", "no_wm_completion": " by electing and/or forming student governments, they will be engaged and more likely to become engaged in their communities.\nIn addition, states need to rethink their civics tests. If civics test questions are designed to elicit only one or two responses, students are never going to be able to use the material as an opportunity to learn the concepts they need to know to navigate adulthood.\nFinally, there needs to be more emphasis on teaching a robust citizenship curriculum in the classroom. The problem is this is very much still a work in progress, and it is not up to schools to do the job of providing that curriculum.\nThe real battle that needs to be fought is not with how many states are adopting civics standards or making more extensive civics course offerings, it\u2019s not how many states have a citizenship test, it\u2019s not even how many states require civics courses. Schools should put the responsibility back on kids to learn more about themselves, who they are, and", "gen_completion": " by electing and/or forming student governments, they\u2019re more likely to seek out civics courses and participate in other civic activities when they grow older. Once you\u2019ve had your civic ed kicked to the curb for eight weeks instead of the three or so it used to be, you\u2019ll appreciate the opportunities being offered.\nFinally, it\u2019s time to start a civics movement. The civics crisis has reached an epidemic stage. The U.S. Constitution is in dire straits since it takes decades to read all of the basic rules. This is why the Supreme Court is looking at whether the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution warrants protection against warrantless searches and seizures. The time for looking into these constitutional questions is now.\nWe have to put civics out there as a national security issue, a human rights issue, a social justice issue, and a global responsibility issue for our nation.

{"prefix": "Apple: dead in the water, or on top of its game?\nSince I was reading this on my iPad Pro, which is probably the most useful electronic device I have ever owned, it came as a bit of a shock. But in fact Volker was really just articulating a truth about digital hardware, which is that the evolution of all such products (and a good deal else besides) follows a sigmoid curve.\nIt sounds complicated, but it isn\u2019t really. Think of it as a version of the letter S that\u2019s been flattened to form a graph whose vertical axis measures functionality while the horizontal axis represents time. What it tells you is that initially (at the lower part of the S) a new technology develops relatively slowly. Then there\u2019s a point where the functionality increases dramatically over a relatively short period, after which the rate of improvement declines steadily and levels off. The iPad is now somewhere on that upper plateau, which means that it\u2019s reached the point where one can only expect incremental improvements (faster processor, better screen, stereo audio etc). This is what Volker was getting at when he said that the device is \u201cdone\u201d.\nTo the hyperactive tech media sector this means that the product is no longer of any interest and that Apple has \u201crun out of ideas\u201d. In some cases it is also taken as confirmation that the company has never recovered from the death of Steve Jobs. Excitable Wall Street analysts may also see it as evidence that Apple stock should now be downgraded to \u201csell\u201d. All of which merely confirms the extent to which some of those who opine about technology don\u2019t understand it.\nSo let\u2019s put the iPad in its wider context. The device, as one expert, Horace Dediu, comments, has an installed base of 300 million users \u2013 which is far larger than the 100-150m Mac computers out there. And whereas the iPad built up this user base in roughly seven years, the Mac needed 33.\nDigging deeper, Dediu finds that iPad sales continue to increase in the US and the UK, and that user satisfaction with the product continues to be very high. A survey conducted in November 2015 found a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for the iPad Mini, a 97% rate for the iPad Air, and 96% for the iPad Pro; and that browsing, shopping and app usage data also show continuing high utilisation on iPads. Among corporate purchasers there is a 96% satisfaction rate, with 66% intending to purchase more iPads.\nMuch the same applies to the iPhone, another Apple device that attracts the same kind of commentary \u2013 about Apple running out of ideas, that there are only incremental improvements between the iPhone 6 and the forthcoming iPhone 8, and so on. The truth is that that device is also on that upper plateau of the sigmoid curve. It too is \u201cdone\u201d.\nThe", "gold_completion": " same applies to the smartphone generally. So the question is: what next?

It\u2019s a nice idea, but it\u2019s still on the lower end of the sigmoid curve. Some day, though, I hope to be able to point my phone at Dr Liam Fox, secretary of state for international trade and president of the board of trade, and see what he\u2019s thinking.

I expect \u2013 as I\u2019ve always said \u2013 Apple to use its event in September to launch a new generation of iPads and Mac Pros.

The 39-year-old winger netted No. 674 on Thanksgiving Night, leaving him just four from passing Kevin Kerr\u2019s 677.\nThe funny thing is, there was every reason to doubt Parsons would ever be in such a position. He only scored 18 goals in 107 career NCAA games at UMass-Lowell, after all \u2013 but there was a reason.\nIt took famously hard-nosed former NHLer Nick Fotiu to put Parson\u2019s soft hands to use. As a rookie head coach for the East Coast Hockey League\u2019s Nashville Knights, Fotiu agreed to his first-year pro\u2019s request to play forward in 1992-93, and Parsons scored 27 goals \u2013 amazingly, his career low for a season \u2013 as a third-line winger.\nParsons was soon on a tour of the ECHL, playing in Tallahassee, Fla.; Johnstown, Pa.; Lafayette and Baton Rouge, La., through 1998-99. The first of his six 50-goal seasons came in his only year in Johnstown (1995-96), and while it wasn\u2019t his favorite stop, none was more important: He met his wife, Kristen, when he was a Chief.\n\u201cDefinitely the silver lining to that year,\u201d said Parsons, today the father of daughters Abby (8), Maggy (6) and Maddox (5).\nThe next season was big, too: In \u201996-97, Parsons first played under well-traveled ex-NHLer Doug Shedden (Pittsburgh, Detroit, Quebec, Toronto) for the first time with the ECHL\u2019s Louisiana IceGators. Shedden next brought Parsons with him to Flint, Mich., where they won the 1999-200 United Hockey League championship, and then to Memphis of the Central Hockey League, where they won back-to-back titles (2001-02 and \u201902-03). Parsons scored at least 54 goals in his first three seasons with Memphis, and was twice named CHL Most Valuable Player.\nThe closest the ride came to ending was after 2006-2007, when Parsons\u2019 Quad City Mallards moved to the American Hockey League, leading the UHL to morph into a \u201cnew,\u201d scaled-down version of the IHL.

{"prefix": "Less than a century since DDT was first sprayed, the spread of the Zika virus through mosquitoes has left some wondering whether regulators were too quick to move away from the chemical. But public health officials warn returning the controversial pesticide to use could do more harm than good in some places.\nDDT, which first came into use as an insecticide in the 1930s, played a crucial role helping Allied forces protect themselves from mosquitoes carrying malaria in World World II and eventually helped eliminate the deadly disease from the U.S. But despite its successes, public opinion turned quickly in the 1960s as outrage grew over DDT\u2019s potential risks to human health and animals and many countries joined the U.S. in ultimately banning its use.\nToday, health officials caution that while the benefits of the pesticide can outweigh health concerns in some contexts, spraying DDT to combat Zika would be premature and potentially very misguided.\nThe first concern for public health officials when considering whether to use DDT is if the method of applying the pesticide will actually kill the targeted mosquitoes. Most applications of the pesticide today occur on the walls of indoor dwellings\u2014targeting mosquitoes that prey on humans while they sleep at night. This tactic, frequently used in Africa, works in areas where mosquitoes carrying disease bite at night while people are asleep, according to Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Public Health. More research is needed to understand other mosquito populations and learn whether DDT use will be effective.\nPolicymakers also have to weigh the potential effects of DDT on human health. The impact of the chemical is not necessarily immediate, but can be devastating to those who ingest it. Research has suggested that DDT has the potential to disrupt the human nervous system in the same way it does to insects. That may mean cancer, infertility and other long-term health effects including developmental problems in young children.

But it less makes sense, at least for now, when combatting a disease like Zika that doesn\u2019t kill those it infects and has yet to spread as widely. Unnecessary use of DDT will also make it less effective going forward as mosquitoes grow resistant. The first round of spraying DDT will effectively kill a large share of the local mosquito population, but fewer and fewer of the insects will die with each consecutive spray, limiting its utility in a future crisis.\nInstead of focusing on pesticides to address Zika, public health officials are now advocating a comprehensive approach to addressing the virus that includes studying the species of mosquito that spreads the virus, developing a Zika vaccine, eliminating places where mosquitoes can breed and potentially introducing genetically modified mosquitoes that will help reduce the population.", "no_wm_completion": " a risk\nBecause DDT has already been suspended worldwide, it\u2019s been several years since the EPA tested an alternative method of using the pesticide to fight Zika.

But even if this research is completed, officials acknowledge it would be difficult to apply the pesticide on a large-scale basis without worrying about unintended consequences, like a new outbreak of mosquitos carried the virus.\n\u201cThere are not a ton of studies out there on where to apply it and how to apply it, especially in tropical regions,\u201d says Paul Ehrlich, a professor of biology and the founding director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. \u201cAll I can", "gen_completion": " a step back, public health officials worry that the current strategy of employing insecticides in order to eliminate mosquito populations could also perpetuate harmful behavior rather than solving the problem.

If people are spraying the insecticide within the home in order to eliminate other pests, people may become reluctant to report suspected mosquito bites to medical health officials.\nAnd the potential impact of the pesticide is also apparent in other parts of the world. A recent study in Brazil showed that the use of DDT to combat mosquitoes carried the Marburg virus in humans, which is known to cause severe encephalitis and a debilitating brain disease that is hard to treat.

Cotter changed his farming methods for financial reasons, not just to fight climate change, and stuck with them long enough to see them pay off.\nCotter sees a new pilot program in the 2018 federal farm bill that pays farmers to experiment with the same growing style as a chance for others to enjoy the economic and environmental benefits he has.\nThe $25 million test project will measure how much additional carbon the agriculture sector can keep out of the atmosphere by leaving fields untilled or minimally tilled and covered with vegetation.\nFarming techniques that fight climate change by increasing carbon stored in soil do not work everywhere, explained Tim Smith, a professor of bioproducts and biosystems engineering at the University of Minnesota. But where they do work, soil quality and productivity improves. They also reduce the need for fertilizers that contribute to carbon in the atmosphere.\nThe pilot program aims to \u201creward farmers for sequestering carbon in their soil, but we need to verify that they are doing that,\u201d said David Kolsrud, who farmed in Luverne before starting a private funding group and working in the renewable-energy sector.\nThe carbon sequestration experiment in the farm bill was the brainchild of an unlikely coalition that includes the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) as well as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the American Coalition for Ethanol. Those normally competing groups came together to persuade Congress to fund a model for encouraging farming that is simultaneously profitable and environmentally friendly.\nThe project will pay selected participants to revive old farming methods to draw more carbon from the atmosphere into the soil and keep it there.\n\u201cAg [has] a major opportunity to protect the climate,\u201d said Nicole Lederer of E-2, a group that advocates for policies that work economically as well as environmentally. Lederer helped broker the deal between the corn growers and the resource council that led to the pilot program.\nFundamentally, the program relies on disturbing the soil as little as possible to limit the release of carbon stored in the roots of plants and decomposing vegetation. It also emphasizes keeping ground covered with crops year-round to prevent the release of carbon from erosion by water or wind.\nCotter said the combination reduces the need for fertilizer. \u201cInstead of spending 20 bucks an acre killing the ground, I want my soil livestock [worms and other organic creatures] doing my tillage,\u201d he said.\nThat can mean planting cover crops rather than letting fields lie fallow. It especially means cutting down on or eliminating tillage, said Lara Bryant, NRDC\u2019s deputy director of water and agriculture nature programs.\nNo-till or low-till farming requires some special equipment. Cotter grows no-till soybeans using an $1,800 adjustment to the closing mechanism on his planter. He grows low-till corn by planting seed in narrow bands about 10 inches wide. He bought a used vertical till machine for $8,000 at auction to help do that and shared the cost of the machine with a neighbor.\nThese sorts of techniques fell out of favor in the 1970s when plentiful land and expanding crop production led farmers to use \u201cmore extractive systems,\u201d according to Bryant. Rewarding those who invest in equipment to return to the old practice is a necessary part of the pilot project.\nThe prospect of cap-and-trade payments for carbon reduction or the development of low-carbon fuel standards and products such as low-carbon feedstock", "gold_completion": " can provide financial incentives, Lederer said.\nThe Minnesota Farmers Union offered its imprimatur to the pilot program as advocates made their case to members of Congress. Farmers union President Gary Wertish said details of how the program will work are still being developed. The basic concept includes paying farmers who undertake healthy soil practices, measuring their success and passing the data on to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to set up payment rates for various practices that could be funded under the agency\u2019s environmental quality incentives program, which averages about $2 billion a year in the new five-year farm bill.\nCalifornia already has a state program that rewards farmers for sequestering carbon in their soil, Kolsrud noted.\nHow well the program would work in Minnesota depends on where you farm. In Blue Earth County, Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap said the short growing season and frozen ground can be obstacles to no-till and cover-crop strategies.", "no_wm_completion": " has drawn more attention in recent years, but farmers, not least because of the way their earnings often fall flat in the recession, still do not have enough incentive for more practices that reduce the carbon that\u2019s in their fields.\n\u201cThe climate change problem is not about who can spend the most money on a technology,\u201d said Smith, whose research focuses on carbon storage.\nThe farmer participation in the project is voluntary. If all goes as planned, it could be expanded. The federal government would assess farmers\u2019 carbon emissions and base their compensation on what they emit. Some might earn rewards for reducing carbon while others could be paid for keeping more.\nThe pilot will be tested on one parcel of land near Austin. It is on a small ranch, part of a farm-to-table effort to produce what local consumers want. \u201cA lot of local folks don\u2019t want to talk about climate change,\u201d said Smith.

His own farm in West Mankato has been going no-till and cover-growing for the last two years, but he\u2019s not sure how it will continue if the program does not pay farmers to experiment in a controlled manner.\nThe federal program might prove too good to pass up for some farmers. Others may feel discouraged after decades of no-till practice and decide to take the pilot project\u2019s money.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t buy into the idea that their field [will] improve, some of them are not going to invest into it,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThe opportunity to receive the payments and the risk of the risk", "z_wm": 3.151400089263916, "z_human": -6.077390193939209, "simcse": 0.84814453125}

Under the new system, average citizens will work alongside judges to issue verdicts in many criminal cases. As Yuriko Nagano reports from Tokyo, the greatest hurdle to the experiment is expected to be persuading Japanese citizens to participate.\nIn Japan, as in most Asian countries, judges alone make decisions in trials. But starting in 2009, juries will be participating in Japanese courts, under what is called a \"saibanin\" system.\nThe new system has not yet been confirmed. At first, it will be tested for three years. And it will be limited in scope. Juries will only be used in certain criminal cases, involving serious crimes such as murder.\nRobert Precht, a U.S. defense lawyer and legal scholar at the University of Montana, is helping Japanese judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers and citizens to implement the change. He spoke to journalists in Tokyo on Thursday.\n\"The saibanin system and these other reforms are intended to transform Japanese citizens from viewing themselves as governed objects into governing objects,\" Precht says.\nFor each trial, there will be a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will be citizens selected at random.\nThe jury panel will sit in the same room with the judges to deliberate on the evidence and reach a verdict.

Experts hope the new reforms will speed them up.\nAnother change to the system will have witnesses take the stand in trials, where attorneys can question them in front of the jury. Currently, all testimony is written, and then given to the judges.\nJapan did use a jury system between 1928 and 1943, but switched to the judges-only process after that.\nThe greatest hurdle, experts say, will be persuading jurors to express their opinions, and even argue with judges.

But he told assembled lawmakers that based on his study of geologic records, he believes warming started significantly before industrialization, in the 17th century.\nHe said the warming the warming since then is natural, and he argued that it's actually a positive thing.\n\"This cold period was marked by crop failure, famine, and mass-depopulation because of naturally-occurring global cooling,\" he said. \"Earth and humanity have benefited greatly from what's been called the long, slow thaw.\"\nMost scientists don't dispute that there was some natural warming after the cold snap of the 17th century.\nBut Wrightstone's broader conclusion, that current warming trends are natural and untethered to CO2 emissions, is directly contrary to the scientific consensus.\nRichard Alley, a geosciences professor at Penn State who specializes in ice core testing, said he doesn't believe there is any natural explanation for the rapid warming that has been measured since the 20th century.\n\"We see the warming,\" he said. \"And then we ask, well is it the sun? No, the sun, if anything is going the other way. Is it the oceans? Well, heat's going into the oceans, it's not coming out. Well, is it anything else we can find? No, it isn't. The CO2 explains what's happening and nothing else does.\"\nMichael Mann, an atmospheric science and geoscience professor, also of Penn State, agreed.\n\"While climate does change naturally, we are warming the planet at an unprecedented rate, putting carbon into the atmosphere a million times faster than the natural geological increases in carbon dioxide that were responsible for e.g. the warmth of the early Cretaceous period,\" he wrote in an email.\nCiting information gathered by the National Research Council, NASA estimates the earth has warmed by approximately 0.7 percent over the last century, which it says represents a rate of warming roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of ice-age recovery.\nClimate change is already harming both human and natural systems.\nWrightstone, who has a master's degree in geology, told the committee that while he has published papers on paleo-climatology, he hasn't written any on contemporary climate science.\nHe has self-published a book on his theories.\nWrightstone spent most of his career in the natural gas industry.\nAfter his testimony, he confirmed he worked as a geologist for the Pittsburgh-based gas company Texas Keystone for 20-odd years, but said the experience doesn't influence his current work.\n\"If I was still receiving payment or being influenced by them, yes,\" he said, his gas industry work might be a", "gold_completion": " factor. \"But that has no influence on me.

Outlets that had previously shied away from, and in some cases covered up, abuses by the Hollywood producer began harassment investigations that saw a host of household media names pushed from their pedestals.\nItaly, home to two of Harvey Weinstein's accusers, also felt the shockwaves. But Italians hoping for a similar impact on their fourth estate, where victim-blaming and objectification are notoriously common - were to be disappointed.\nInstead, two features marked the fallout: the near absence of names named, and the ferocious reaction faced not by the accused, but the accusers.\nItaly, it would seem, had missed its \"Weinstein moment\".\nThe problem is, it's difficult to expose such cases, especially when they happen in the industry that is supposed to be doing the exposing! And that's an industry whose leaders tend to be, on the whole, men.\nSix months on from the scandal, The Listening Post went to Rome and Milan to ask journalists and media experts why the scandal played out so differently in Italy, and to discuss the problematic representation of women in Italy's media more generally.\nOne of Weinstein's Italian accusers is the actress Asia Argento, whose testimony of sexual assault met a media response that - with some exceptions - ranged from scepticism to open abuse.\n\"First they go along with it, then they whine and pretend to repent\", goaded a headline in the conservative newspaper, Libero. Libero's editor, Vittorio Feltri, was one of several prominent journalists to label Argento's story as one of \"prostitution\" - comments that his deputy, Pietro Senaldi, happily defended in his interview with us.\n\"You have to know the man,\" Senaldi insisted. \"It is well known that his journalistic career and his reputation are based on how direct and how blunt he his \u2026\"\nFor Elisa Giomi, a sociologist specialising in gender and media at Rome Three University, it was a feature she told us, that is typical of media coverage of such cases in Italy: \"a tendency to split the victims of sexual harassment into two categories: the innocent ones and the women who asked for it.\"\nWe asked all our contributors why so few cases of harassment, including in the media industry itself, had been uncovered by Italian journalists. Pietro Senaldi's explanation was simple: \"What I think is that in Italy, this phenomenon has not exploded because it is less dramatic than it is in the States. Definitely less dramatic.\"\nIt's a notion each of our female interviewees strongly disputed, pointing out that such cases are not hard to find - if you are looking for them.\n\"Just because there have been no denunciations to date doesn't mean it isn't happening in the media as well,\" said Claudia Torrisi, a contributor to VICE Italy.\n\"The problem is, it's difficult to expose such cases, especially when they happen in the industry that is supposed to be doing the exposing!

A 27-year-old woman was also injured in the attack, but she managed to escape along with upstairs tenants as a fire consumed the building.\nOn Feb. 4, the Broome County District Attorney's Office offered to settle a recent set of felony charges against Pica-Torres \u2014 burglary, grand larceny and criminal mischief \u2014 by a guilty plea to a misdemeanor petit larceny in Binghamton City Court. A prearranged sentence would be jail time served and three years of probation, and the felonies would be dismissed to satisfy that outcome.\nOn Feb. 7, with those charges to be resolved, prosecutors asked judges in Broome County and City of Binghamton courts to release Pica-Torres from jail on his own recognizance to await his next court date. On Feb. 8, he was released from jail.\nThat legal step, and the timing of Pica-Torres' murder arrest so soon after being released, sparked criticism Wednesday from Paul Battisti, a Binghamton lawyer campaigning for Broome County district attorney.\nHis opponent is current Chief Assistant District Attorney Michael Korchak, and both candidates are expected to face off in a Republican primary election. District Attorney Steve Cornwell is not seeking a second term.\nDuring a Wednesday news conference, Battisti said he believes the Walnut Street murder/arson could have been avoided if Pica-Torres hadn't been released from jail.\nBattisti said that for the charges Pica-Torres had pending before the murder arrest, he could have served a mandatory prison sentence if convicted. He also could have been convicted as a persistent felony offender, a designation that carries a potential sentence of 25 years to life.\n\"The current administration at the District Attorney's Office is utterly broken,\" Battisti said Wednesday. \"Any reasonable person would come to the conclusion that a repeat violent offender with a history of domestic violence is a threat.\"\nCornwell responded late Wednesday in a statement: \"Shame on Paul Battisti for exploiting the death of a victim for political advantage. Mr. Battisti is hiding behind the fact that we are prohibited by law from discussing a pending case.\"\n\"His misleading information is nothing more than an unethical political stunt intended to fool voters,\" Cornwell added. \"We aggressively prosecute cases based on the facts and the law, not on speculation.\"\nPica-Torres has been charged with felony counts of second-degree murder, second-degree arson and first-degree burglary in connection with the Walnut Street case.

In stepping up to promote the deceptive practices at CPCs, state lawmakers continue to support this charade and participate in deceiving everyday Minnesotans who are seeking needed health care.\n73 percent of CPCs told patients that abortion is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, a claim rejected throughout the medical and scientific community.

Five Supreme Court justices sided with them, and Trump\u2019s Title X proposal would back their deceptive practices with public dollars.\nOver the past month, I\u2019ve been traveling across the state and hearing from people who rely on affordable birth control and other reproductive health care to finish their education, achieve career goals, or just to lead healthier, happier lives.

Then visit us in person.\nRaised in September 1862, the 155th NYVI served with distinction until July 1865. Almost all of the men of the 155th were Irish; many of them had only come to America since the time of the Famine of 1846-47.\nThe 155th was raised as part of Michael Corcoran's \"Irish Legion,\" a brigade containing the 155th, 164th (zouave), 170th, 175th, and 182nd New York Volunteers. Members of Companies \"I\" and \"K\" came from Buffalo, New York, and the 164th also contained Buffalo recruits. The regiment fought under both the flag of the United States, and a green, regimental color with Irish and New York state symbols.\nThe 155th's first fight was in January 1863 in Virginia, and over the next two and a half years, the regiment actively campaigned in the East. It served in a number of major battles, including the Siege of Suffolk, Virginia; Spotsylvania, North Anna, and Cold Harbor, where the regiment saw its heaviest losses. The 155th took part in the Siege of Petersburg, and fighting around that area, and it was part of the forces that chased the Army of Northern Virginia to its destiny, being present at the that force's surrender at Appomattox Court House.\nThe unit mustered into United States service with 820 men; by July 1865, only 130 men were present at Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Virginia.\nDuring the war, many 155th members also belonged to the Fenian Brotherhood. After the war, these veterans joined the 7th New York Regiment of the Irish Army of Liberation, which in June 1866, joined the Fenian invasion of Canada, fighting the Battle of Ridgeway, Ontario, and several smaller actions around Fort Erie. Though victorious on the field, the heavily outnumbered, and unsupported attempt to take control of Canada (to hold for the exchange for Irish independence from Great Britain), failed. The direct result of this skirmish was the granting of Canada's independence from England in 1867, while in the United States, the Fenian movement faced a rapid decline. 2016 Reenactment Info: Battle of Ridgeway/Fenian Raid.\nThe present reenactment regiment was formed in 1989, and now numbers around 120 members, including: soldiers, musicians, surgeons and medical staff, nurses, \"sanitary commission\" members, and civilian women, men, and children.

{"prefix": "Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s memoir of her pioneer girlhood, written in 1930, has remained unpublished until now.\nIn 1930, Laura Ingalls Wilder decided to write a memoir of her pioneer girlhood. She was a sixty-three-year-old chicken farmer, living in the Ozarks with her husband and their daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, a well-known journalist and popular author. Wilder\u2019s own literary ambitions were, she told Lane, for \u201cprestige\u201d rather than for money, and they may have dated to her youth, though they had been thwarted by a married life of hardship and calamity.\nWilder would certainly capture the big market. She lived to the age of ninety, and published eight novels for young people\u2014the perennially beloved \u201cLittle House\u201d books\u2014that have sold some sixty million copies in more than thirty languages. In the nineteen-seventies, the third installment of this family saga, \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\u201d was adapted as a drama for television that ran for nine seasons. The Wilder farmhouse, in Rocky Ridge, Missouri, has become a shrine that receives some forty thousand pilgrims a year, and six other sites mentioned in the series are landmarks or museums devoted to its lore. But the memoir that Wilder drafted during the first year of the Depression, in her tidy longhand, filling a series of school notebooks, was never published until now.\n\u201cPioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography\u201d is a handsomely illustrated, large-format volume that represents years of work by a team of scholars. Their project was sponsored by the South Dakota Historical Society, and published by its state-subsidized press last November. Its modest first print run quickly sold out, and it is currently back-ordered on Amazon, where it occupies the number one slot on the best-seller list in the category of American biography. Wilder fans are a devoted breed, and there is nothing surprising about the book\u2019s popularity\u2014until you wade into it.\nMy greatest trouble this spring was that I couldn\u2019t get past the multiplication table at school. I just couldn\u2019t memorize it and we couldn\u2019t go on to arithmetic until we could say the multiplication table. Those who passed were going up stairs next terms and I would have to stay behind. So I was glad when Ma said she needed me to help her and I would have to stay out of school for a while.\nI helped Ma with the work, ran errands and every day worked sums in multiplication looking back at the multiplication table to help me when I couldn\u2019t remember.\nOne day when I came back from an errand that had taken me a long time, I found a new little sister.\nWilder desperately needed an editor, and luckily she had one\u2014if not something more. Rose Wilder Lane\u2019s astute and rigorous biographer, William Holtz, made a persuasive case, in \u201cThe Ghost in the Little House,\u201d that Lane was her mother\u2019s ghostwriter. She encouraged Wilder to recast the memoir as a series of \u201cjuveniles,\u201d and, in the course of a decade, they cannibalized, sanitized, and romanticized \u201cPioneer Girl\u201d for the \u201cLittle House\u201d books.", "gold_completion": " At least initially, however, it was Lane who shaped the narratives and polished the prose.\nPamela Smith Hill, the project leader and editor of \u201cPioneer Girl,\u201d is a prominent Wilder scholar, and a passionate advocate for her subject. In her introduction to the memoir, she acknowledges Lane\u2019s role as a midwife. But she also defends the integrity of Wilder\u2019s authorship against the slurs, as she sees them, of Holtz and others. It is difficult to reconcile Hill\u2019s perception of Wilder\u2019s \u201cevolution as a writer,\u201d her \u201cdescriptive genius,\u201d and her techniques for creating \u201ctension and suspense\u201d with the evidence of the manuscript. \u201cSome critics,\u201d she concludes, \u201chave charged that Wilder could not write.\u201d One has to agree with them.\nThe mother and daughter behind the Little House stories.", "no_wm_completion": " Their work\u2014and their motives (the money) are not an open question; we are forced now to wonder how much Wilder\u2019s life was changed for the worse.\n\u201cPioneer Girl\u201d opens with wild and impulsive Laura Ingalls Wilder and her young family, fleeing the Mississippi floods for the safety of their farm in Rocky Ridge, Missouri, in the fall of 1836. The book\u2019s title alludes to \u201cWilder Rose,\u201d the family dog, and a number of characters are introduced who play pivotal roles in the book as the Ingalls move upcountry with the onset of winter.\n\u201cWe were still in the midst of a long flood, which had washed away vast quantities of corn and grain, and the farm-furnishings and crops that had been so important to us,\u201d Wilder tells us, \u201cand we had become almost all destitute.\u201d There are echoes of the", "gen_completion": " Their revision\u2014which resulted in Laura being portrayed with childlike innocence and Rose viewed with youthful resentments and suspicion\u2014caused all manner of heartache and consternation among the generations who had come to regard Wilder as a \u201cpioneer hero.\u201d\nYou think it\u2019s all over, don\u2019t you, Bill, and then you get a letter from the editor asking if it\u2019s all over. \u2013 Laura Ingalls Wilder\nOne aspect of the revision, when it was over, that caused one of my colleagues, John J.

{"prefix": "Look out! There's an app barreling toward your skull, and it's going as fast as a car.\nAmong the most powerful things about the first iPhone was how it made old software metaphors \u2014 pressing buttons, scrolling through pages \u2014 much more literal. Scrolling was now linked, one-to-one, to the tip of your finger. You didn't click a button on a mouse to command a software cursor to press a button for you, you just tapped it with your thumb. This was a profound change and one that was hard to advertise or talk about. But it was something that users were able to grasp almost immediately.\nMovement in iOS, and in Android, is generally directly connected to one of two actions: a tapping or swiping, or hitting a button or dragging (or pushing!) something around. The weirdest these direct actions really get is pinch-to-zoom, which is somehow intuitive but doesn't really have a real-world equivalent. These are all vital in making iOS feel like iOS.\nAlso vital: the animations, which, in iOS 7, are centered around zooming. Or, more accurately, flying. Tapping an icon sends it flying at your face, at which point it begins to transform into an app. Closing it pulls it back away from you; it's as if the app is falling into the screen. Our minds take every other movement metaphor in iOS literally, but this one is weird. It feels three-dimensional in a way that others don't.\nThe sensation of depth is exaggerated in iOS 7, and profound enough that it led some users to complain of a sort of seasickness (which Apple both acknowledged and provided a fix for, in an update).\nI used the small-angle approximation since the size of the object (in this case the app) is significantly smaller than the distance from which you are observing it. This allowed us to assume that the apparent size of the object is inversely proportional to the distance from which you are observing it.\nIn order for an iPhone app to appear to be the width of an iPhone icon, it would have to be about 5.33 feet away. That is to say, if iOS animations suggest that the icons are falling away from you, they are falling about 5 feet, and moving pretty fast. Assuming it takes about 0.8 seconds for this animation to complete, the app is moving at an average of about 6.6 feet per second, or about 4.5 miles per hour: a slow jogging speed.\nThose 19.29 feet are traveled, again, in about 0.8 seconds, which works out to a little more than 24.1 feet per second, or 16.4 miles per hour. That's an average too \u2014 the animation accelerates then decelerates. Or", "gold_completion": " at least it looks that way. It seems probably that, at its top speed, this icon is flying at or away from your face at over 20 miles per hour.\nKind of casts that motion-sickness stuff in a new light! iOS 7 certainly hints more strongly at depth than iOS 6, in which the zooming felt less physical. It was more like expansion than zooming, a closer relative to pinch-to-resize.\nUpdate: Developer Steve Streza provides some background, on Twitter: \"Those animations are based on spring physics. So it's like you stretched a spring from you to the folder and then let go... Animations pre-iOS 7 were based on sine wave curves. iOS 7 animations have a more gradual decay.\" Thanks Steve!\nAnyway, now you know why iOS 7 doesn't just look different, it feels different: Every time you close an app to a folder, you're hurling it about 25 feet away from your face.", "no_wm_completion": ", more precisely, accelerates (the animation is always redrawn every second; we are in a zoom-in mode), decelerates (the timer resets every few seconds) and accelerates again.\nFor you math majors, you can use that 24.1-foot per second velocity to calculate 20 percent of 21.8 miles per hour, or 14.8 miles per hour. That sounds pretty fast, but it's actually pretty slow for iPhone applications. That's a whole world away from the average speed of a typical human body: running a marathon might take somewhere between 5 and 7 hours to run, but for most people it's going to be a mere 17 minutes or so.\nFor this reason, this type of animation is not common on iOS. It's one of the more prominent non-interactive gestures. But some folks still like it, so maybe we should keep it available, even if it's just to indicate that the app is sliding toward your face.", "gen_completion": ", taking in all of these numbers: the Apple logo would be about 19 feet, which in actuality would be just 16.2 feet from iPhone icons. That's a lot closer.\nThe fact that these animations are even so close to the real thing is the main way this feels so real: if you are holding your smartphone, it seems as if iOS is still going all out:\nYou can get closer, but it's a bit harder than holding your finger in a place where it doesn't feel like you are a mouse or anything else. You don't want to move your thumb too much to move the mouse, or to touch the buttons that your finger is already on, just because: even the very slow motions look like a serious amount of movement. So you must always move just a little left or right \u2014 moving your thumb just a little left is enough to move your thumb to move something else, which moves something else, which moves something else, as long as it feels", "z_wm": 4.788491249084473, "z_human": -6.656189441680908, "simcse": 0.69482421875}

At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, and armed with only an acoustic guitar, she tore through \"Nobody Love,\" her debut album's first single, and delivered what was generally considered to be the show's most striking performance.

But when things go sour -- you get harassed online, you post something controversial or you otherwise get the Internet mad at you -- those stated rules of community courtesy become some of your greatest tools.\nSo it makes sense, then, that you should actually be able to understand them, right?\nThe makeover comes shortly after the company unveiled the design of its data use policy and privacy menus to be more friendly to its growing (and, often, aging) userbase.\nThis is almost entirely a cosmetic change, the company said. \"We're not changing anything about the policies,\" said Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management. \"We're just trying to explain what we do more clearly.\"\nPreviously, Facebook's Community Standards page was serviceable -- a single page that you could scroll through to find the policy that you wanted to peruse. It wasn't hard to navigate, but it wasn't easy either.\nNow, the baseline rules of conduct on Facebook are grouped into four categories -- such as \"Keeping you safe\" -- that aim to make it easier to find a policy on a particular subject and offer a little more about Facebook's policies.\nThe new design also includes descriptions of existing policy that Facebook hasn't put in its community standards before, but do explain how the company currently operates, Bickert said.\nFor example, there's a section now in the community standards that explains how the company deals with \"Dangerous Organizations,\" which makes it clear that Facebook doesn't allow \"terrorist activity\" or \"organized criminal activity\" to have a place on its site. The company had broadly covered that prohibition in its previous standards, but decided it was worth explaining a little more deeply in the new format. Facebook has also broken out a section detailing \"Attacks on Public Figures.\"\nBickert said that the company wanted to keep the language as simple as possible since the community standards are universal across the company's approximately 1.3 billion users -- covering Facebookers of all ages, on all platforms and in all of the countries where the network reaches.

The company reported that it's seen an overall increase in government requests for restrictions, up 11 percent over the past six months.\nGovernment requests for account information, the company said, stayed flat overall, though spikes in some countries such as Turkey were offset by declines in other countries such as Pakistan.", "no_wm_completion": " March 19; Facebook isn't just putting it up in the US and UK -- it's starting to roll it out in other regions, as well.\nBeyond the cosmetic changes, the company put a few new policies on its site, including updates to policies that had been in place for a while, but didn't fit into a specific section of the site. The company added a section to its \"community standards about violence,\" which deals more with physical harm than online threats, and also added several policies about how the company handles sexual harassment and abuse.\nAll the new pages, policies and general content on a given issue is all organized into a sort of \"hub\" under the \"community standards\" section of Facebook's website, on top of the content itself.

Section 3303 established statewide rules for oil and gas activities irrespective of existing or future local zoning rules. Section 3304 required municipalities to allow oil and gas development activities in all zoning areas.\nThe court\u2019s ruling is significant in that it nullified these three provisions of Act 13, but even more so because of the court\u2019s reason for doing so.

{"prefix": "Looking at your Facebook page may help you accept criticism and weather attacks on your ego, a study suggests.\nThat time you're spending on Facebook may not be wasted productivity, after all.\nAt least, that's what yet another Facebook-based study has found.\nYou may remember Stuart Smiley, the fey self-affirmation addict portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live\" by now-Sen. Al Franken. He stares into the mirror and declares, \"I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and, dog gone it, people like me.\"\nThat's what Facebook does, according to a study published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.\nWe already know that looking at other people's fun times on Facebook could make you envious. And we've seen that you are what you like on Facebook \u2014 a computer algorithm based on \"likes\" can home in on such things as sexual orientation, political leanings and psychological traits including openness and conscientiousness.\nSo, think of your Facebook page as Stuart Smiley's mirror: It contains a lot of your core beliefs and preferences, and it puts your network of friends and family at your reach. In psychologist language, it can \"satisfy fundamental ego needs regarding desired self-images.\"\nYou can't directly measure any Facebook bump in self-esteem or any bump generated other ways. But you can measure defensive behavior to criticism. It's been shown that the self-affirmation experiences similar to those spoofed by Stuart Smiley reduce defensive responses that are naturally elicited by ego threats.\nPsychologists have tested this repeatedly. Usually they ask a participant to list strongly held beliefs and write an essay about the top one. After that, the participant invariably reacts better to a blow against the ego. The essay acts as self-affirmation.\nThe participant who chooses to write about a lower-ranked value but about how others may think it's important generally is more defensive. The essay had no self-affirming effect.\nTurns out, looking at your own Facebook page is the social network equivalent of that first essay. Looking at another person's page is the non-affirming experience.\nCatalina Toma, at the University of Wisconsin, and Jeffrey Hancock, at Cornell, study communication and social networks. They devised two experiments. In the first, some students got to look at their own Facebook page, while others looked at a stranger's page (it turned out to be another study participant's page). Some wrote the self-affirming essay, while others wrote the more neutral one.\nNow the ruse: Participants were told they were there to evaluate a distance-learning public speaking course. Each was to write a short speech on the legality of abortion and deliver it to a camera, then get feedback and rate the feedback by various aspects. The trick: Participants wound up with the same negative feedback.\nWhat happened? Results were as expected: less defensive response from people exposed to self-affirmation activity; more from those who did not get that experience. And it turned out that the proportion between those two responses was the same for those who wrote the essays as for those who viewed Facebook pages.\n\u201cFacebook has just as big an effect on self-esteem as traditional tools,\u201d Hancock said.\nBut would someone who gets a negative feedback actively seek solace in Facebook? The second experiment tested that. They used a similar cover story: testing a public speaking program. But this time feedback was randomly negative or neutral. After the feedback, participants were allowed to choose an activity: looking at their own Facebook page, watching YouTube videos, listening to online music, reading online news or playing online video games.\nAfter receiving neutral feedback, participants were equally likely to choose any of", "gold_completion": " those activities. About 30% chose Facebook. But nearly twice as many chose Facebook after negative feedback.\nWell, maybe more people prefer Facebook over the other activities, right? Researchers took that into account.\nFacebook's rank among the activity choices (tested before the experiment) for those who got negative feedback was lower than the average rating of the other activities.\nWhy would any of this be important? Well, it gives experimenters a new tool to use instead of the essay, and there are about a billion people who use Facebook in any given month. That's a gigantic laboratory.\nBut Facebook might one day be part of therapies that use self-affirmation, such as programs to quit smoking or to change other habits.\n\u201cAnything you need to be stronger at, self-affirmation is good for you,\u201d Hancock said.\nMaybe you'll find that you're good enough, smart enough and, dog gone it, people press the like icon on your posts.", "no_wm_completion": " the three in response to a negative feedback-exposure. What's more, self-affirmation also reduced defensive reactions to all types of feedback, although defensive responses dropped when people got the experience that they knew was an illusion even though it felt real.\nSo the theory is this: If the experience of liking your Facebook walls was real, it was still possible to use it as a form of self-affirmation, but it may well suppress or diminish defensive reactions when it comes to negative feedback.\nThe findings may be a way to explain why one of the most popular social networks has become so divisive and polarizing over time.\nSocial networks have become more pervasive. We use them for friendships, relationships and jobs. We look at others' posts and profile pictures when we want to feel better about ourselves. We share status updates. But some of us are starting to question whether we really care and should we even be on Facebook at all.\n\"Social media has increased our feelings of", "gen_completion": " the activities compared with negative or self-affirming, no-choice groups; but self-affirming participants were no longer less defensive than those in the no-choice side.\n\u201cThe fact that self-affirming has no effect in the negative feedback condition is not bad news for the self-esteem of those in the no-choice activity group,\u201d Toma said.\nShe adds, however, that the effect on defensive behavior might not be as dramatic as it sounds. The negative feedback would be equally disruptive to a person's sense of self. The point is: Some who might not want to appear defensive might choose that route.\n\u201cWhat is concerning is there is evidence that this process of defensive response reduction after reflection on negative feedback is actually part of the self-confidence building process,\u201d Toma said.\nBut for the public speaker, this might come with other problems, she said.

There could be funky stuff going on in the computer system, and I would never know why.\"\nWhat makes this one so bad?

It's the kind of thing you should never tamper with. And it should obviously remain heavily guarded.\nBut Macs purchased one year ago or before, apparently, leave a door open.\nWhen a Mac goes into sleep mode and wakes back up, it allows direct access to the BIOS.

{"prefix": "Recently, I was gifted with a little bottle of blessed oil brought from an orthodox monastery in Greece. The aroma of this blessed oil is powerful, profound and, yes, mystical.\nObviously, when I say mystical, I am not talking about esotericism. The joint document, entitled \"Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of life: A Christian reflection on the 'New Age'\" issued by the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Council for interreligious Dialogue, describes it as \"a search for knowledge, and magic, or the occult\". On the contrary, what is mystical is revealed because it is not the theoretical knowledge for the chosen few but holiness as the everyday bread and butter for every person. As Jesus himself tells us: \"Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven \"(Matt 5:19). Therefore, Christian mysticism is about being great and not being small. It is about being authentic and not fake by placing oneself above others.\nThe bible teaching which tells us that you and me, thanks to Jesus' Spirit in us that we received both at our baptism and at our confirmation, lives in us, is found in Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians. Here Paul says: \"But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?\" (2 Cor 2:14-16).\nBoth Jesus Christ and Satan have their aroma. The aroma of Jesus Christ is \"love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control\" (Gal 5:22-23). Moreover, the Bible tells us that Christ's aroma is also compassion, \"kindness, lowliness, meekness, ... patience, ... forgive[ness], ... perfect harmony,... love,... thankful[ness], teach[ing], admonish[ing] one another,... do[ing] everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, [and] giving thanks to God the Father through him\" (Col 3:12-17).\nAlmost every person I anoint and pray over with this blessed oil tells me: \"Father! What a nice smell this oil has!\" You are hundred per cent right my dear brother and sister! Because, if you and I carry within our hearts love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, patience, forgiveness, perfect harmony, thankfulness, teaching, admonishing one another gently, doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus and giving thanks to God the Father through Him we certainly smell beautiful. The reason is that it is no longer our weak smell of sin that we carry in our hearts but Christ's fragrance. And, when you and I let God's Spirit live in us and cultivate within us these holy and beloved attitudes then Jesus can look at us and say to us personally: \"How sweet is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice\" (Cant 4:10).\nYes!

Because Satan's aroma is eternally destructive, the Bible lovingly warns us to keep away from it: \"those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God\" (Gal 5:21).\nWhen you meet me, especially at Mater Dei as I visit patients, their families, hospital staff and going round the hospital following the example of the Merciful Shepherd, remind me to anoint you with this aromatic oil, place my consecrated hands on you and pray that you too be transformed by Christ's aroma.", "no_wm_completion": " important than any of our old habits, our old sins, our old worries, problems or failures.

These calls created a number of patient care problems and strained hospital ER services.\nCommunity paramedicine is designed to address these issues. Numerous articles and studies cite the overall benefits of this model, showing how in the long run, non-emergency patients need fewer trips to the ER.\nHowever, ER services are again under stress due to the current nationwide opioid crisis. Emergency medical services must respond to countless overdose calls that burden EMS workers and take away necessary resources from other emergencies.\nA recent study shows that many overdose patients do not get the care that they need to break the cycle, even after one or more emergency trips to a medical facility. However, an interesting new measure has emerged that meets the need to help drug overdose patients.\nAccording to Dan Swayze, community paramedicine can be used to monitor opioid-addicted patients detoxing at home. Swayze says a couple of cities are starting to use this model, which could be a boon to the community and potentially reduce the number of opioid-related drug overdoses.\nEmergency medical services will continue to change as the needs of local municipalities change. Community paramedicine is definitely changing the way EMS agencies are reacting to opioid overdoses. If community paramedicine is widely used to monitor addicts at home, it may prove to be a tremendous asset in breaking the opioid epidemic cycle.\nAllison G. S.

Now, in the 21st century, dedication to harnessing top-of-the-line technology is even more necessary.\nWe live in a post 9/11 society.

We also know that terrorist organizations are actively pursuing chemical, nuclear, and biological weaponry. Quite simply, there are those who want to hurt America and rob us of our freedoms.\nOur Founding Fathers knew that these freedoms were so precious that they were worth protecting and worth defending. They also knew, as we know today, that one of the realities of having these freedoms is that there will always be individuals who want to take them from us. To lack vigilance in our investment in national security fails a central tenet of our constitutional duty \u2013 outlined in the first sentence of the Constitution \u2013 to provide for the common defense.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that reconciling defense spending with our rapidly increasing national debt and deficit is a big task.

However, we cannot use the national debt as an excuse to jeopardize our national security. Washington can \u2013 and must \u2013 get its fiscal house in order without cheapening our national security.\nToday, the danger of eroding our defense budget stretches beyond the battlefield. The ripple effects don\u2019t just touch our men and women in uniform, federal workers or defense civilians.

That was really beautiful to me as an artist,\u201d she said.\nTempest\u2019s gender and Jewish heritage made her an unlikely apprentice. Still, Oguma instructed her in not only the art of making sushi, but more practical matters: how to save money, by conserving plastic wrap for example, and how to stand up to suppliers selling fish beneath her standards.\nNamed one of Zagat\u2019s \u201c30 under 30 rock stars\u201d redefining the restaurant industry in New York City in 2016, Tempest struck out on her own, working for a brief time at the now two Michelin-starred Sushi Ginza Onodera.

She\u2019s brought that Sushi by Bae concept to Bouhadana\u2019s new Sushi by Bou spot at the Jue Lan Club, a posh Chinese eatery in the Flatiron District.\n1. She moved to New York to study art at the School of Visual Arts, where her thesis involved sushi.\n2. She considers herself an artist whose medium is food, rather than a chef.\nIn addition to shaping rice, she added, \u201cThere are artful ways to score the fish that make it fold more aesthetically over the rice than [other ways].\u201d Tempest pays close attention to the way her sushi looks when it\u2019s served, so she\u2019s developed her own techniques for cutting fish to present it from its best angle.\n3.

{"prefix": "There was much to be disappointed by in President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview over the weekend, from his curious belief that climate change might reverse itself to his contention that his mocking of alleged sexual assault victim Christine Blasey Ford is immaterial now that \u201cwe won\u201d and Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court. But there\u2019s at least one thing he said that ought to disturb Americans right in their core beliefs. Asked about the apparent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, President Trump vowed \u201csevere punishment\u201d if it turns out that Saudi Arabia ordered his death, but he expressed great reluctance to use the most powerful leverage available to him \u2014 the pending $110 billion arms sale to that country \u2014 on the grounds it would hurt U.S. manufacturers.\nSo there it is. The price of justice has been set. Do at least $110 billion worth of business with a favored industry within the United States and human rights are meaningless. Truth is meaningless. Once again, the Saudi royal family is demonstrating to the world that everyone has a price. The values that Americans claim to hold dear are actually negotiable when contracts and jobs are on the line. No wonder China and Russia and other regimes with questionable human rights records want to do business with the U.S. We are a paper tiger made from greenbacks. Lock us into enormously valuable contracts, and we\u2019ll purr like kittens.\nMight it be too early to judge the Trump administration morally bankrupt when the matter hasn\u2019t been fully investigated? Perhaps. But President Trump doesn\u2019t exactly have a sterling record for investigations, given the FBI\u2019s recent whitewash of Professor Ford\u2019s alleged teen encounter with Judge Kavanaugh, neither of whom federal gumshoes could be bothered to interview. What similar treatment is waiting for the case of the missing Washington Post columnist? Rounding up the usual suspects? Blaming MS-13? You don\u2019t have to be a Democrat to be appalled by this administration\u2019s tolerance of Saudi misconduct. Congressional Republicans are grumbling about the response, too \u2014 including Sen. Marco Rubio who was on TV Sunday saying neither Saudi money nor its occasional help reining in Iran should cause the U.S. to lose sight of its role as a defender of morality and human rights.\nIndeed, congressional action may ultimately be the only way to be certain a serious punishment is meted out against the Saudis \u2014 much as it took Congress to force the administration to keep pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin. Mr. Trump\u2019s loyalties often seem to run toward making money and not toward defending this nation\u2019s ideals. He\u2019s only too willing to risk economic success in trade wars. He\u2019ll take that gamble in the name of greater economic success. But standing up for free speech? That\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to be in the Trump DNA. At least not like commiserating with autocrats about the", "gold_completion": " hardships of dealing with reporters (\u201cenemies of the people,\u201d as the president likes to say).\nThe apparent death of Jamal Khashoggi matters. Not just because he was a harsh critic of the Saudi government but because there are many more Jamal Khashoggis out there writing and reporting on the terrible things other countries and other regimes are perpetrating against their citizens. If the U.S. and its allies are willing to look the other way in this case, even slightly, what is to keep all those other despots from doing the same? Earlier this month, we got the answer when the body of 30-year-old Viktoria Marinova was fished out of the Danube. The Bulgarian TV journalist had been beaten, raped and strangled after reporting on corruption in her country. She was the third European journalist to be murdered this year. Who will stand up for them and for the people they are helping inform if not the U.S.?", "no_wm_completion": " price of justice.\nIf that wasn\u2019t the case, this administration would not be making any attempt at all to pass off this horrific murder as a rogue incident, despite the obvious connections between Saudi Arabia and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, whom Saudi officials say was a \u201crogue\u201d who \u201cdied under tragic circumstances\u201d while trying to leave the country. It would not be taking the words of Mr. Trump himself at face value, after he told CBS News\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that Khashoggi was \u201cbadguy\u201d and \u201cdid it.\u201d Nor would it be trying to persuade Congress to keep pressure off Saudi Arabia. In the interview, the president seemed to be saying that he just wants to make the sales anyway.

{"prefix": "Back in the mid-1990s, I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, then vice president at IBM, who was charged with building a new generation of supercomputers. But Dr. Wladawsky-Berger didn't go out and spend a huge budget on specialized hardware. Rather, the genius of his approach was to take sets of already-manufactured processors -- at the time, RISC processors from IBM's Unix family -- and lashed them together with a high-speed switch to create supercomputing power. A few years later, the follow-on generation of supercomputers was built in a similar fashion from x86 processors running Linux.\nWelcome to innovation, 21st Century style. A couple of months ago, I posted some observations about innovation coming from low-cost and conveniently available parts -- part of the formula for success for our era: \u201cGood enough\u201d may be good enough when it comes to developing new products and services.\nOne powerful byproduct that has emerged from this paradigm is supercomputers. The latest and fastest behemoth, as a matter of fact, was built from PC chips from Advanced Micro Devices. The supercomputer, as described by The New York Times' Ashlee Vance, runs at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee \"and can throw hundreds of thousands of processing engines at computing problems.\"\n\"The supercomputing world was long dominated by systems that required specialized chips, memory systems and networking technology. But about 10 years ago,", "gold_completion": " researchers realized they could link thousands of cheaper machines running on mainstream chips and achieve pretty solid performance.\"\nThe idea that many small commodity processors could work together to provide supercomputing power is being seen in other forms, such as grids. For example, the SETI@home project employs individual users across the globe, who donate unused cycles to help sift through data in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\nThe Top500 list of the world's current top 500 supercomputers was just released, and just about all are built with commonly available commodity processors. In fact, 79% of the world's fastest supercomputers run on clusters of Intel EM64T processors.\nAcross all product categories, the high-end brands, typically offered as part of well-crafted and expensive interdependent architectures, will be displaced by more modular approaches offered by commoditizers. In the process, new markets will open as more companies or people have access to more affordable approaches. Or even supercomputers.", "no_wm_completion": " IBM decided to do things differently and instead build huge machines using inexpensive CPUs powered by widely available software,\" writes Vance.\nIn the last decades of the 20th century, the world's top supercomputers were powered by the most expensive technology available. Today, that technology is almost completely obsolete, and the world is shifting to low-cost and easy-to-install components -- such as processors assembled by a group called The Open Compute Project. The biggest challenge has been to develop an appropriate framework for integrating this kind of low-cost, easy-to-install kit with high-performance compute systems.\nThe basic elements of the Open Compute Project platform are an open storage platform (X.25) that has been implemented on supercomputing hardware and a simple network (Nebulas) that has been implemented on commercial network gear to create a \"transparent hybrid\" infrastructure.\n\"As far as the technical strategy for scaling these resources, we use a strategy that works very well", "gen_completion": " computer scientists and computer architects found that it costs as much as a million dollars to license the software that makes up most supercomputers. And those same groups developed new ideas -- many of them small enough and cheaper to build from bits of technology instead. The result is a revolution in modern high-performance computing.\u201d\nAnd with the advent of cloud computing, supercomputers can be deployed to any cloud provider. The system can be a commodity or custom machine. The software can be delivered anywhere -- even on your smartphone. From here, supercomputers can be deployed on any device -- and the software is delivered in a simple application -- that in turn can be deployed on any device (or be cloud-native like most cloud applications).\nWe need many more models to help us design new products. However, our current system is built to create innovation from low-cost, easily available parts. That's why so many innovation cycles have hit bottom.
